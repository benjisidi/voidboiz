# A Night at [[The Sapphire Lute]]
The group spends the evening at [[The Sapphire Lute]], gathering more information on the recent disappearances. [[Lug]] attempts to chat with a trio of identical triplets, but they are not interested in conversation. Meanwhile, [[Octesian]] distracts himself by stealing a spoon—a less-than-subtle attempt that nearly gets him caught. Luckily, Chloe, the barkeep, is too busy in the kitchen to notice.

Eventually, the group decides to investigate the house of the most recent victim to see what clues they can find.
# Investigating the Missing villager’s House
The house is partially collapsed, as if something large smashed through it from the outside. Despite the damage, there is surprisingly little blood, suggesting the victim was taken alive.
- [[Lug]] inspects the wreckage and confirms that the damage came from outside—something broke in and dragged the victim away.
- [[Rue]] casts Detect Magic but senses nothing unnatural. However, she notes that there are spells capable of doing something like this.
- [[El]] searches for tracks but finds no footprints—whatever did this left no visible trace.
- [[Octesian]] investigates the house further and finds a ledger documenting previous disappearances.
## The Disappearances
The ledger reveals a pattern in the victims.
- Three weeks ago - Ermano, a young mill worker, disappeared while exploring the woods. The triplets at the tavern are actually his brothers.
- Two weeks ago - Sabina, a close friend of Chloe, vanished while walking home at night.
- One week ago - Ruben, the owner of a hunting lodge, disappeared in the forest.
- A few days ago - Tito, the shopkeeper, was taken from his home—his house is the one they are currently investigating.
# Speaking with the Neighbors
The group decides to ask around for witnesses. They knock on the door of a nearby house, where they meet Enrico, a Kenku resident.
- Enrico says he didn’t see anything, but he heard a loud crash the night Tito disappeared.
- He mentions that Ermano had been talking about exploring the ruins in the woods before he vanished.
- According to local folklore, the ruins have been there for centuries and are rumored to be haunted or connected to portals to other realms.
- Enrico believes whatever took Ermano came from the ruins.
# A Visit to the Hunting Lodge
The group heads to Ruben’s hunting lodge, where they meet Monica, a female Leonin lounging by the fireplace. She seems wary but agrees to speak with them.
- She describes Ermano as an outsider, unfamiliar with the dangers of the forest.
- He believed in ghosts and thought the ruins were cursed.
- Monica thinks the disappearances are magical in nature—she doesn’t believe in ghosts, but she knows something unnatural is at play.
- She also mentions a group of young people in town who dabble in magic, including Lucia, the girl who took them in at Geo’s farm.
# Questioning [[Lucia]]
The group returns to Geo’s vineyard to speak with Lucia, but she is not home. They decide to search her room for clues.
- [[Octesian]] easily picks the lock to her bedroom.
- [[Rue]] casts Detect Magic and finds a hidden drawer containing a glowing spellbook.
- [[El]] recognizes the writing as Abyssal, a language often used in demonic magic.
- [[Lug]] reads the spell—it is a ritual for summoning a demon, but something about it seems tampered with or incomplete.
- The book also contains three vials—one of water, one of blood, and one of ash—components for the summoning.
- Flipping through the pages, [[Rue]] realizes that the spell was meant to summon something to keep Ermano from leaving town.

The group now knows that Lucia was trying to summon something related to Ermano—but did it go wrong?
# Following [[Lucia]]’s Trail
Determined to find Lucia, the group follows her footprints leading into the woods. The tracks lead directly to the ruins, where they find disturbing signs—small dead animals scattered around the clearing.

They call out for Lucia, but instead of her voice, a small boy answers. He introduces himself as Mateo.
- [[El]] approaches Mateo and gently takes his hand—only to feel a sharp, burning pain as his fingers twist into claws.
- The boy transforms into a demon, revealing his true nature.
# Executive Summary
The group investigates a series of disappearances in [[Terra Nova]], discovering that all of the victims had connections to the ruins in the woods.

They learn that Lucia, the girl who took them in, had been performing a summoning ritual—one that was incomplete or altered. They suspect that her attempt to summon something to keep Ermano from leaving backfired, bringing something far worse into the town.

Following Lucia’s footprints to the ruins, they encounter Mateo, a young boy who suddenly transforms into a demon, confirming their worst fears.
