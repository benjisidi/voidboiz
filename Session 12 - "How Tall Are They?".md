# [[Mystras Temple]] And the Island
The VOID BOIZ explore the stark, otherworldly landscape of the meteor-like island:
* The island is harshly lit by a nearby star at a sharp angle, leaving one side of the cathedral in deep shadow while the other is brightly illuminated.
* The enormous cathedral, made of glass and polished rock, dominates the tiny island, carved directly from the rock itself.
* [[Octesian]] stealthily opens the massive iron gates to the cathedral, slipping inside. [[Grey]] admires the intricate craftsmanship of the structure, a testament to divine artistry.
# The Plinth and the Story of the [[Titans]]
The group ventures into the cathedral, finding a large room with a raised plinth and locked double doors at the far end:
* On the plinth are three wooden figurines:
     A snake.
     A chimera-like monster.
     An insect-like creature.
* These figures match titans depicted in the frieze on the walls. [[Lug]] deciphers the story carved above the frieze:
     The astral plane was created by three gods, who were challenged by the titans, monstrous beings of immense power.
     The gods chained the titans in the ether using colossal chains (like the ones the crew saw during their journey).
     A great flood covered the titans, infusing their magic into the sea.
     To contain rebellious mortals, one of the gods created the Nine Hells, a prison for those who defied divine will. “Never again would the people of the planes be blessed with immortality.”
    * A massive battle erupted between the gods, mortals, and the demons of the Nine Hells. The gods gave mortals divine relics to aid them, including a book—likely the artifact the VOID BOIZ seek.
    * [[Talos]], Grey’s god, gifted mortals a “chest of thunder” to use against their demonic foes.
# Activating the Door
[[Lug]] deduces that the wooden figurines can be placed on the floor in a specific way to interact with the room:
* [[Lug]], [[Grey]], and [[El]] position the figurines on the floor.
* [[Octesian]] hides, anticipating danger.
* The room reacts: water begins to rise rapidly, and the carved titans on the walls animate, emerging as physical foes.
* [[Lug]] examines the titans, identifying their weaknesses as the party braces for an intense battle.
