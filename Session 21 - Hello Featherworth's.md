# The Storm Church Heist
With suspicions growing about the Stormcall ritual, the group decides to steal a small statue from the church archives to learn more about the relics kept within.
- [[Grey]] stages a spectacular trip, smashing his hammer against his shield and drawing every eye in the church to him.
- [[Rue]] quickly reduces the size of the figurine using magic and throws it to [[Octesian]], who catches it and tucks it into his bag.
- [[Octesian]] helps [[Grey]] up, convincing the clergy that it’s best if they leave.
- As they depart, [[Rue]] uses Mage Hand to pull back the hood of a man in burnt-orange robes.
- She sees the flaming crown tattoo of the [[Chantry]] on the back of his neck.
- The man immediately locks eyes with her. She holds his gaze, then casually turns away and follows the others.
# A Chaotic Trip to the Market
The group leaves the church and heads back to the market district to sell the stolen figurine and buy new gear.
- [[Octesian]] immediately bumps into the man he tried to pickpocket earlier.
- The man grabs for him, but [[Octesian]] effortlessly dodges.
- [[El]] attempts to trip the man with her staff but misses.
- [[Grey]] has had enough of this nonsense and goes off in search of food, with [[Rue]] following.
- [[Octesian]] makes a run for it, dropping a smoke bomb and vanishing into the chaos.
- [[Rue]] and [[Grey]] find a bakery and purchase delicious cheese twists.

Meanwhile, [[Octesian]] arrives at Ziri’s forge, sitting casually on a workbench, munching on an apple, as if nothing happened.
- He sells the stolen figurine, receiving a decent payout.
- [[Rue]] and [[El]] catch up with him, annoyed at the mess he caused.
# Searching for Jeremiah and Heading to the Squalls
[[Rue]] recalls that she wanted to find Jeremiah, an old contact, and asks the bakery owner about him.
- The baker directs her to Randal Silverback’s bakery in the Squalls, the rougher part of town.
- Ziri mentions that [[Eliana Quickshadow]], a known fence, operates nearby.

Curious about Lunavesca’s underworld, the group decides to visit Featherworths, an infamous criminal marketplace disguised as an upscale establishment.
# Entering Featherworths
Featherworths is part department store, part underground criminal hub. At the entrance:
- A massive Goliath guard stops them, demanding they surrender their weapons.
- [[Grey]] is immediately distracted by the Goliath’s enchanted talking sword. He attempts to flirt with it. The sword is not interested.
- After a weird exchange, they hand over their weapons and head inside.

Inside Featherworths, the group splits up.
- [[Octesian]] and [[Grey]] head to the gambling tables.
- [[El]] and [[Rue]] go to the bar to eavesdrop on conversations.
# The Gambling Hall
At the tables, [[Octesian]] sits down with a group of locals and strikes up conversation.
- He hears news from his hometown—rumors that the leadership of the [[Gilded Shadows]] has changed.
- The new leader is Symmond, and the previous leader, Eryn, has vanished.
- This news visibly unsettles him. He quickly excuses himself from the table.

Meanwhile, [[Grey]] loses 10 gold gambling.
# The bar and Featherworth Himself
Over at the bar, [[El]] and [[Rue]] notice a group of criminals gathered around a VIP booth.
- Sitting at the head of the group is [[Featherworth]]—a shrewd, intelligent crime lord who looks like an actual owl.
- He exudes the aura of someone who never raises his voice, because he never needs to.

Before approaching him, [[El]] inquires about rare animals. The bartender tells her that [[Featherworth]] can help with that.
# Enter The Viper
Across the room, [[Octesian]] spots a familiar figure.

A woman dressed in deep red, lounging with effortless confidence.

She is Seraphina, known as The Viper—a legendary con artist and Octesian’s former acquaintance from Greyhaven.

The moment their eyes meet, she smirks knowingly.

[[Octesian]] downs his drink and heads toward her.
# Executive Summary
The group steals a relic from the Storm Church, confirming that a member of the [[Chantry]] is inside the clergy. [[Rue]] makes direct eye contact with the man before leaving.

They sell the stolen relic, Octesian causes chaos in the market, and Rue looks for an old contact in the Squalls.

Arriving at Featherworths, the group encounters Lunavesca’s criminal elite.
- Octesian learns that his old guild, the [[Gilded Shadows]], has a new leader.
- El and Rue spot Mr. Featherworth, a powerful crime lord.
