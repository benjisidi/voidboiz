# Battle with the Goblin Pirates
The VOID BOIZ engage in a chaotic battle against the goblin pirates:
* [[El]] struggles to find her footing but manages to throw a goblin overboard and board the enemy longboat.
* [[Octesian]] topples a plank between the ships, sending goblins into the sea. Despite missing later attacks, he remains steadfast.
* [[Rue]] casts entanglement, restraining the goblin boss and others, but is struck by arrows and falls unconscious before being revived by Grey.
* [[Lug]] fires cannons below deck, damaging a longboat, and later uses acid spells to attack the goblins.
* Grey protects Rue and deals heavy damage but dramatically falls to an arrow before being revived by Rue. He finishes the goblin boss with a hammer uppercut.

The battle concludes with the defeat of the goblins. The crew inspects the longboat, finding wooden amulets shaped like a three-fingered hand. [[Octesian]] cuts a piece of the sail as a trophy.
# Exploring [[Lugland]]
After a short rest, the group explores the island, encountering:
* Red melon-sized fruits with delicious liquid inside.
* A clearing with a large, orange thorny plant that fires its thorns at them when attacked.

[[El]] spots a thin trail of grey smoke from the treetops, and the party decides to follow it. They create a small shelter out of earth and take a long rest.
