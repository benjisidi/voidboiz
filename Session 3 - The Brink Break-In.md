# Executive Summary
The group collects their reward from [[Mayor Eret]] for defending [[Brink]]. They meet with [[Lana Skylark]], who reveals she was disgraced as an admiral while searching for the [[Sunlight Symphony]], a holy relic. The map to the relic is in [[Mayor Eret’s Mansion]], and she enlists the group to steal it under the cover of a fake burglary.

After scouting the mansion, the party devises a heist plan, securing a crate from the dockyard. [[Grey]] and [[Lug]] pose as delivery workers, sneaking [[Octesian]] and [[El]] inside. While inside:
- [[El]] discovers a house arrest order for [[Lana Skylark]].
- [[Octesian]] uncovers a shady deal between [[Mayor Eret]] and [[Borack]].
- They retrieve the map, but botch the lockpicking and carry the crate out manually.
- [[Octesian]] leaves behind the Skull Talisman as a calling card.

The group successfully escapes into the night with the map, setting the stage for their next adventure.
# Rewards and Recognition
Following their efforts in defending [[Brink]], the group heads to the town hall to collect their reward from [[Mayor Eret]]. The hall, still bearing the scars of the recent battle, has temporarily become a command post.
- [[Mayor Eret]] personally hands each of them 20 gold for their heroism.
- The party pushes for a title or medal, but the mayor only vaguely entertains the idea.
- He recommends they visit [[Godoro’s Luxury Shop]] for a post-battle shopping spree.
# Shopping and Scheming
At [[Godoro’s Luxury Shop]], the group peruses fine clothing. [[Octesian]] plays distraction while [[El]] inspects a unique Gloomcloth Cloak, which turns out to be remarkably affordable at only 12 gold.
- [[Lug]] searches for a mask, but finds nothing suitable.
- [[Grey]] inquires about magical items and is shown a Cloak of Elvenkind, but at an exorbitant price of 5000 gold.
- Ultimately, the group leaves with only the Gloomcloth Cloak, which [[El]] stealthily passes to [[Octesian]].

Their next stop is [[The Diamond Devil]], where they celebrate their victory over drinks and meet with [[Lana Skylark]].
# A Mission from [[Lana Skylark]]
The party finds [[Lana Skylark]] drinking honey mead, deep in thought. She is interested in their knowledge of the Skull Talisman, revealing that her disgrace as an admiral stemmed from a mission to retrieve the Sunlight Symphony, a holy relic. Her ship stumbled upon unsanctioned ships bearing the Skull Talisman, leading to accusations that she had deliberately sabotaged the mission.
- The Problem: The map to the relic is in [[Mayor Eret’s Mansion]], but the mayor doesn’t know its significance.
- The Plan: The party will stage a fake burglary, stealing random valuables while securing the map.
- The Disagreement: The group is hesitant about working with Lana, but [[Octesian]] is eager for the heist.
- The Reconnaissance: Before committing, they scout [[Mayor Eret’s Mansion]], noting its stone walls, perimeter guards, and a patrolling drake.
# Preparing for the Heist
At [[The Sweet Treat]], they grab cheese toasties and attempt to secure a crate for their plan. The bakery owner refuses, forcing them to visit the [[Dockyard]] instead.
- [[Lug]], using his dockworker connections, acquires the perfect crate, marked “IMPORTANT.”
- They initially plan for [[El]] to hide inside, but after reconsidering, they decide that [[Octesian]], as the group’s thief, will take the risk.
# The Mansion Heist
Disguising themselves as delivery workers, [[Grey]] and [[Lug]] approach the mansion gates, pushing a cart with [[Octesian]] hidden inside. They are stopped by the guard, a stout dwarf with a drake companion.
- [[Grey]] demands tea service as a distraction while the guards inspect the crates.
- [[Lug]] recounts his “kill” from yesterday, trying to sound impressive.
- The guards are unconvinced, but allow them inside.

Inside, the crates are placed in the lounge, and while the guard is distracted, [[Octesian]] and [[El]] emerge from hiding.
- [[El]] sneaks into the grand library, discovering a second valuable cloak and a family history book that mentions her family but not her specifically.
- [[Octesian]] explores the study, finding a silver bell (which he later returns) and a manifest of [[Lana Skylark]]’s possessions.
- [[El]] finds a letter signed by [[Commander Darius Vorn]], ordering [[Lana Skylark]] to be placed under house arrest.
# The Map and Escape
Finding the hidden crate, [[Octesian]] attempts to pick the lock but fails. [[El]] tries, but snaps the lockpick inside the padlock.
- Frustrated but determined, [[Octesian]] lifts the entire crate.
- He leaves behind the Skull Talisman as a calling card, taunting the mayor.
- [[Octesian]] also uncovers a contract between [[Mayor Eret]] and [[Borack]], indicating illegal dealings.

With the map crate in hand, the group makes their escape through the gardens.
- [[Grey]] catches the crate as it is tossed over the wall.
- [[Lug]] uses his magic rope to help them climb out.
- The group disappears into the night, successful in their heist.
