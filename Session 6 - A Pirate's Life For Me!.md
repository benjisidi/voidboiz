# Joining The Panther
The group boards [[The Panther]], a dark blue brig captained by [[Lysander Lightfoot]]. They meet the crew:
* [[Rowan]], the navigator with sharp teeth and extensive tattoos.
* [[Powell]], the one-armed cook with a mechanical prosthetic.
* [[Arianwyn]], the aasimar topman with striking white hair.

Lana awkwardly designates Octesian as the acting captain to avoid suspicion. The group begins learning to man the ship as they leave [[Brink]], bound for [[Grimlock]].
# Navigating The Gate Nexus
The Panther approaches a massive Gate Nexus, a chaotic hub of floating iron rings connecting ships across wildspace. The crew navigates through, experiencing a brief but intense encounter with the chaotic flow of ships before heading toward Grimlock’s calmer waters.
# Discovering the Smuggling Plot
While exploring the ship, [[Lug]] discovers a hidden deck containing barrels of IMAR whiskey, a highly valuable smuggled cargo. The group uses this leverage to threaten [[Lysander Lightfoot]] into handing over command of the ship.
# Convincing the Crew
The group splits up to persuade the crew to join their cause:
* [[Octesian]] convinces [[Rowan]] to side with them for a better profit, though Rowan avoids fighting.
* [[Lug]] charms [[Powell]] with tales of adventure in wildspace, appealing to his boredom with mundane shipping runs.
* [[Arianwyn]] is skeptical but agrees to join after speaking with [[Lana Skylark]], whom she recognizes as a former admiral.
# Mutiny and Commandeering The Panther
The group confronts Lysander, tying him up and threatening to expose his smuggling to the [[Grand Stellarium]]. After extracting information, they drop him off near Grimlock and fully assume command of The Panther.
# Celebrations and Plans
The group celebrates their newfound ship with a barrel of whiskey. [[El]] explores Lysander’s cabin, finding valuables including a collapsible looking glass, which she gives to [[Octesian]]. The group debates their new pirate status and prepares for their journey into wildspace as a storm brews on the horizon.
