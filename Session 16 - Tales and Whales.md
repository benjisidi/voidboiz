# The Aftermath of the Supernova
[[The Panther]] is in bad shape. The sails are tattered, the hull is scorched, and the ship is barely holding together after the chaos of their escape from [[Mystras Temple]]. [[Grey]] and [[Rue]] inspect the damage while [[Octesian]] delivers an *inspiring* speech to the crew, emphasizing that they should all be proud of themselves—especially [[Octesian]].

[[El]] speaks with [[Arianwyn]], sharing a little about her past in the capital. Meanwhile, [[Octesian]] explores the secret cargo hold beneath the trapdoor and finds that about a third of the smuggled cargo is still intact, but much of it has spilled and is leaking. He scoops up a flask of floor whiskey for later.

[[Octesian]] speaks with [[Lana Skylark]], who is deeply unsettled. With the temple’s destruction, she doubts that anyone will believe their story about [[Sunlight Symphony]]. Worse, she is terrified by the prophecy hinted at in the book and wants no part in keeping it. [[Octesian]] quips, “I don’t believe in tales,” to which [[Lana Skylark]] dryly replies, “But whales?”

They discuss where to go next. [[Rowan]] suggests heading to [[New Harvest]], a tropical island with renowned vineyards and a town called [[Terra Nova]]. After everything they’ve been through, the crew agrees that a week of rest sounds like a good plan—but first, they must repair the sails.
# The Mending of the Sails
[[Lug]] prepares to learn the mending spell for the next day, while the crew gets to work with a temporary fix. To make it more *interesting*, [[Rue]] provides goodberry juice to use as paint, and they decorate the patched sails with thousands of tiny, staring eyes. [[Octesian]] approves of the aesthetic, and thus, the ship sets sail under the watchful gaze of their new eldritch fashion statement.
# The Secrets of [[Sunlight Symphony]]
With some peace and quiet at last, [[Lug]] finally reads [[Sunlight Symphony]]. The book contains a collection of fables about [[Mystra]], including:
- A retelling of the war they glimpsed in the temple, showing how [[Mystra]] chose a mortal group to aid and gifted them the book. The book granted them a powerful protective aura.
- A cautionary tale about a prodigy wizard who sought to become a god and overthrow [[Mystra]], nearly destroying the Weave in the process. His ambition led to wild magic surges across the world, and the gods were forced to kill him before his actions could end all of humanity.
- The last part of the book contains spells, incantations, and rituals. [[Lug]] discovers that attuning to the book grants protective magic, and he can use it to cast Silvery Fire, a spell specifically designed to destroy the undead.
# A Week at Sea
With no immediate threats, the crew settles into a routine. Everyone takes up morning workouts and sparring sessions to keep their skills sharp. [[Octesian]] in particular is *very* enthusiastic about becoming a wolf boy, though how he intends to do so remains unclear.

Eventually, they spot [[New Harvest]] on the horizon—a lush, green island with a thriving wine industry. [[Terra Nova]] lies further inland, a day’s ride from the docks. The crew decides to dock at the wharf, giving their ship a much-needed rest.
# Arrival at [[Terra Nova]]
The crew docks the ship, registering it under a false name—“The Pantheon”—for the next four days. They meet François, the dockmaster, whose French accent becomes stronger with every sentence.

[[Lana Skylark]] and [[Rowan]] rent horses to ride to [[Terra Nova]], while the rest of the group acquires a party bus (a cart) to make the journey. Along the way, [[Rowan]] reminisces about his time in the area, mentioning an old friend named Geo, who owns a vineyard and frequently took him in when he *needed to disappear for a while*. [[Octesian]] pretends *not* to be jealous.

Before leaving, [[Octesian]] retrieves a barrel of whiskey from the ruined cargo hold, intending to use it for trade. [[Rue]] suggests barreling the strange aether whiskey into something safer for transport—possibly foreshadowing future mischief.
# The Vineyards of [[Terra Nova]]
As the cart rolls into town, they find themselves in a picturesque Italian-style village, with rolling vineyards and fantasy Tuscany vibes. [[Rowan]] leads them to a farm on the outskirts of town, where he is greeted by Lucia, the young woman who now runs the vineyard. She warmly welcomes him home and helps the group settle in.

Inside, they meet Geo, the head of the household, who happily accepts a barrel of whiskey as payment for their stay. [[Grey]] asks for a tour of the house, indulging in his ongoing architectural fascination. The place is peaceful, a far cry from the chaos they’ve endured recently.
# A Growing Unease
While most of the group relaxes, [[Rue]] feels something is wrong. There’s an undercurrent of tension in the town—people seem on edge. After settling into their rooms, [[Rue]] wakes up [[El]] and convinces her to investigate.

They head to The Sapphire Lute, the local tavern, where they meet Chloe, a half-wood-elf barkeep. She explains that the town has been plagued by disappearances.
- The first victim was Ermano, a mill worker, who went missing in the woods.
- Tito, the owner of the village shop, disappeared next.
- Four people total have vanished, and the town has grown more fearful.
- The most recent case was different—the victim’s house was partially destroyed, as if something had torn through it to get them.
- Chloe believes that staying inside has only made the creature more aggressive.

After gathering this information, [[Rue]] and [[El]] return to the farm and wake everyone up. [[Octesian]], still half-asleep, almost jumps out the window to escape the commotion, but [[Lana Skylark]] calls him out: *“That’s not very captain of you.”*

Thus, the crew heads to the tavern for more information.
# A Town Full of Secrets
- They meet three identical triplets, all dressed alike, who seem oddly unfriendly.
- [[Octesian]] goes in search of gelato, engaging in casual housing market speculation for absolutely no reason.
- [[Grey]] suggests two plans:
    - Hold a daily party to lure out the creature.
    - Have two people patrol every night to catch whoever (or whatever) is responsible.

With the town growing more nervous by the day, the group knows they need to act fast before another disappearance occurs.
# Executive Summary
[[The Panther]] barely survived the supernova, and the crew sails to [[New Harvest]] for repairs. [[Lug]] studies [[Sunlight Symphony]], learning that it contains divine fables and powerful anti-undead magic. The crew paints their sails with thousands of eerie eyes and heads for [[Terra Nova]], a vineyard town.

Upon arrival, they reunite with [[Rowan]]’s old friend, Geo, and settle into his home. However, [[Rue]] senses something is off—the town is afraid. Locals speak of mysterious disappearances, the most recent involving a house being torn open in the night.

The crew decides to investigate, with [[Grey]] suggesting elaborate trap plans and [[Octesian]] pretending he doesn’t care.
