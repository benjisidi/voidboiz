# The First Entry
The void boiz are invited into the home by a green warforged man ([[Baxter]]). They are led into the foyer where they wait a bit, and then get led into a room with a big split stairwell and then a side room.
We meet a human man ([[Lord Erebus]]), in his 40s, drinking out of a porcelain cup.
