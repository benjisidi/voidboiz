# Goblin Island and the Magic Heart
The VOID BOIZ continue exploring Goblin Island:
* The group battles goblins, encountering a caged tiger and a magic elk.
* [[Rue]] detects that the heart object [[Lug]] picked up is magical, capable of slowing time and glimpsing the future.
* The party loots the goblin village for rations and takes a long rest.
* [[Rue]] and [[Octesian]] share a bonding moment.
* They return to [[The Panther]] and set sail.
# Sailing Days
The group settles into life aboard [[The Panther]]:
* [[Lug]] experiments with the magical heart.
* [[Octesian]] helps out in the kitchen.
* [[Grey]] sunbathes shirtless, attempting to tan.
* [[El]] spends time with [[Arianwyn]].
* [[Rue]] practices her long shots alongside [[Lana Skylark]].
* [[Arianwyn]] spots something unusual in the distance.
# Mystery Chain
Using the looking glass, [[Octesian]] spots a giant, ancient chain floating in the ether, with the final link broken and suspended unnaturally. [[Lug]] recognizes tales of gods chaining creatures beneath the ether. The chain is marked on the map for potential later exploration, but the group decides to continue their journey.
# The [[Farseer]]
A massive, many-eyed creature known as the Far Seer approaches:
* [[Rue]] recognizes it and asks, “Far Seer, what do you see of us?”
* It ominously replies, “They come, like an ocean, they come, they break upon the shores of the living and wash away the light,” referencing an insignia linked to the skull previously found in [[Brink]].
* [[Lana Skylark]] reveals that this force was responsible for sinking her previous ships.
# Arrival at Mystra’s Temple
After spotting their destination—a tiny meteor-like island with a cathedral-sized church—the group prepares for what lies ahead:
* The party shares a “last supper,” anticipating danger.
* In the morning, they disembark onto the small island, ready to explore the grand cathedral.
