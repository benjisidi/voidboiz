# Interactions with the Crew
The VOID BOIZ deepen their bonds with the crew aboard [[The Panther]]:
* [[Rowan]] reveals he is a shifter, demonstrating his painless transformation into a werewolf-like form. Grey is fascinated by the process.
* [[Powell]] shares that he lost his arm to a cannonball and hasn’t considered upgrading it. The group collectively looks to [[Lug]] for potential help.
* [[Arianwyn]] shows her dedication to the crew despite a rocky moment. After getting seasick (from the smuggled rum) and throwing up overboard, she agrees to a friendly competition with Octesian, racing him to the crow’s nest. Though Arianwyn initially leads, Octesian pulls ahead using his rogue skills and wins. She begrudgingly heads to bed after her defeat.
# Sailing Montage
The party spends two weeks contributing to life aboard the ship:
* [[Rue]] improves her skills as a deckhand, eventually becoming useful.
* Grey assists with cooking, carpentry, and morale, acting as a bosun.
* [[El]] learns to climb the rigging and shares lookout duties with [[Arianwyn]], showcasing her sharp eyesight.
* [[Lug]] learns navigation under [[Rowan]], slowly grasping the complexities of astral sea charts and gates.
* Octesian manages supplies and maintenance, grappling with doubts about his leadership skills.
# Encounter with a Large Bird
While on watch, [[El]] spots a large, tired bird. [[Rue]] feeds it goodberries, restoring its strength. The bird flies toward a distant island, which [[Lug]] dubs [[Lugland]]. Octesian, curious, redirects the ship toward the island.
# Discovery of Lugland
The island is a small, rocky outcrop with some greenery. As the crew observes:
* [[El]] sees the bird hunting over the island.
* [[Arianwyn]] spots two longboats approaching, flying a goblin pirate flag.
* Grey identifies the flag as belonging to a goblin pirate crew.

The session concludes with the crew preparing for battle.
