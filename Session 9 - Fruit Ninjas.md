# Morning on Goblin Island
The VOID BOIZ wake up and explore more of Goblin Island:
* [[El]] and [[Octesian]] fail to climb trees for fruit, so [[Rue]] helps by bringing it down. Grey spots the roc on the mountainside but notices the smoke has disappeared.
* A troop of monkeys begins following the group, and they find a patch of gotlens flowers.
# Snake Attack
A monkey steals [[El]]’s waterskin containing fruit juice. She chases it but encounters a giant snake that begins constricting her. The group rushes to help, killing the snake after a fierce fight.
# The Ravine and Mushrooms
The group discovers a ravine filled with glowing electric blue mushrooms. [[Rue]] picks one, inhaling spores that cause hallucinations and strange behavior:
* Rue hallucinates a bear and summons an earth wall to protect herself.
* She perceives the party as bizarre entities: [[El]] as a cyclops, [[Octesian]] with a briefcase, [[Lug]] as a flamingo with a top hat, and Grey as an alarm clock.
* The group ties Rue up to calm her, with Grey carrying her as she continues to hallucinate. Eventually, she sobers up without comment.
# PAY THE TOLL
The party encounters goblins on a forest path. [[Lug]] and [[El]] demand a toll, provoking an immediate attack. The battle results in:
* Grey’s spiritual weapon tearing a goblin in half.
* [[Octesian]] shooting a fleeing goblin coated in grease.
* [[El]] tracking down a hiding goblin.
* [[Rue]] landing a longbow shot, killing the final goblin with a headshot.
