# A Lil Discovery
The crew head over to the [[Lunar Archives]] to find out more about Werewolf's and how to defeat them. They are met by [[Mirrorwarden Mireya]], they enquire about [[Garrick Durrow]] and she admits he has been quite problematic. She gives them a book, [[Codex Furore]], which is a compendium of particularly fanatical cults and sects throughout the syndicate. She suggests Durrow may have started an incarnation of the [[Cult of the Ravening]] here in Lunavesca.

[[Mirrorwarden Mireya]] suggests getting weapons dipped in silver to fight the the werewolf, she also recommends no dark or decay magic but instead to go for elemental spells. Lug and Octesian pay to get their weapons dipped.

While at the [[Lunar Archives]], they decided to investigate the relics further, there ain't much juice. They start to look into undead or meteor situations, they find an article about a meteor hitting [[Lunavesca]] a year ago. Maybe something we can investigate?

*Rest.*

They visit [[Rascal]] in the morning to see if he has any info, suggested we go down to the docks, there are brothers known as the [[Banero brothers]], aka, Kinder bueno brothers, there who is behaving suspiciously and has some noticeable changes in appearance, there have also been ''street rats'' who have gone missing.
# Docks
The docks took quite the beating from the storm but the Blue Goliath is still standing. Octesian tries to draw out some street urchins but instead gets robed lol. They go into the BG and spot their pal [[Ruth]], they enquire about the [[Banero brothers]] and she mentioned they've not worked for a while as Ralph got sick. Eric is the other brother who is sometimes about the docks. They go to the foreman for more information, [[Heimlich]], they get the brothers address.

[[Cowboy]] the kid calls us over, tells us Peter has gone missing, that lots of kids have gone recently. The kids have been staying away from the docks to avoid being taken. He says Peter went to look for the missing kids at the docks at night. Cowboy offers us free rides for life for finding his pal.
# Habanero Bros
We go collect our silvered weapons from [[Lunar Archives]] and then head off to the address of the [[Banero brothers]].

At the Banero residence, we encounter Eric, who is very skittish and on-guard, and his extremely sick brother. We try to interrogate them, which isn't going well until Rue recognises the disease Ralph has; she can cure it with Lesser Restoration. Hearing this, Eric finally tells us that he was hoping to cure Ralph by having him take part in the lycanthropy ritual. Eric kidnapped Peter from the docks, and delivered him to the cult to be used as a sacrifice.

This brings us to now! We are going down to the woods to save Peter, hopefully get a bounty, and save two lives (Ralph's and Peter's).
