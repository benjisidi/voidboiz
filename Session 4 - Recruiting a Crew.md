# Executive Summary
The party uncovers a chest with several valuable items, including a flintlock pistol and an old star map leading deep into [[Wildspace]]. They meet with [[Lana Skylark]], who is still intent on acquiring a ship. Their search leads them to [[Lysander Lightfoot]], a smuggler with a heavily modified ship, *[[The Panther]]*. Through a mix of deception and persuasion, they convince him to take them on a journey, securing their passage into the unknown.
# Secrets In a Chest
The group, minus the sleeping Grey, start the day in a [[Brink]] bakery. Inside, they attempt to open a locked chest, which Octesian struggles with before [[Rue]] effortlessly wrenches it open. Within, they find several intriguing items:
- A flintlock pistol inscribed with *Last Rights*.
- A Ring of Catching Arrows.
- A star map, incredibly aged and leading somewhere deep into [[Wildspace]].
- Assorted jewelry and rings, including what appears to be a uniform.

[[Lug]] quickly makes a copy of the star map before returning the original to the chest.
# Negotiations At The Diamond Devil
They take the chest to [[The Diamond Devil]], where they return most of its contents to [[Lana Skylark]]. She immediately asks where her jewelry is, and [[Rue]] falsely blames [[Octesian]] for taking it. The party shifts the conversation to the matter of acquiring a ship.

[[Lana]] suggests contacting [[Lysander Lightfoot]], a smuggler with a ship outfitted for stealth. The group debates whether they should pay for passage, steal the ship, or kill him outright.
# Finding Answers in The Glass Dice
The party heads to [[The Glass Dice]] gambling den, where they seek out [[Orin]] for information. After some drinks and gambling, Rue finds Orin and learns:
- [[Lysander Lightfoot]] has no active bounty, meaning no one will come after him.
- [[The Panther]] is his prized ship.
- [[Ilbor]], a pirate captain with a 10k gold bounty, is operating nearby on *[[The Sea Wolf]]*.

While Rue gathers information, Octesian attempts to swindle a table of gamblers but only walks away with a single silver in profit. Meanwhile, Lug loses money as he gets too engrossed in conversation.
# Securing A Ship at The Twisted Tankard
The party moves to [[The Twisted Tankard]], a dockside bar, where they spot [[Lysander Lightfoot]]. While [[Lug]] gathers information about [[The Panther]]â€™s crew, [[El]] successfully flirts with Lysander, convincing him to take them aboard under the pretence that she has a trustworthy crew.

Unbeknownst to him, the "trustworthy crew" consists of the very people planning to betray him.
# Plans In Motion
With their way onto *[[The Panther]]* secured, the party now holds the keys to reaching their destination in Wildspace. Whether they simply use the ship for transport or take it for themselves remains to be seen.
