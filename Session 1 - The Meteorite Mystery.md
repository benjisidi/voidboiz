# The Meteorite Impact
In the dead of night, a massive explosion shakes [[Brink]]. A fireball streaks across the sky and crashes outside of town, sending a pillar of smoke into the air.

[[Rue]] and [[El]], who were awake at the time, decide to investigate, making their way toward the crash site. Meanwhile, [[Lug]] and [[Grey]] choose to go back to sleep, and [[Octesian]] watches the commotion from a window before eventually joining the investigation.

Upon arrival at the impact site, [[Rue]] and [[El]] find a large crater, still radiating heat, with a red-hot meteorite embedded at its center. [[Rue]] casts *Detect Magic* but senses nothing. [[El]] notices a pack of wolves in the distance, watching them cautiously. Finding no immediate danger, they return to town.
# The Town Meeting
The following morning, the town crier calls everyone to the town hall for an emergency meeting. [[Mayor Eret]], a burly, no-nonsense official of the Syndicate, takes the stage and demands an investigation into the meteorite before lifting the lockdown on the docks. A local merchant, [[Arlan]], offers 20 gold to any volunteers willing to investigate. [[Octesian]] enthusiastically raises the offer to 30 gold, eager to leave town. One by one, the party agrees to take the job.

As they prepare for the mission, they gather supplies. [[Lug]] collects his gear, including a dagger, a tiny hammer, and a giant shield. The group then stops at [[Grey]]'s home, where they find various half-built contraptions, giving off the impression of a cluttered workshop. He arms himself with leathery chainmail and a well-worn hammer, showing signs of a long-forgotten warrior past.
# Encounter In the Crater
Returning to the crater, the adventurers take a closer look. [[Octesian]] and [[Lug]] climb down and chip off a piece of the meteorite, confirming it is nothing more than rock. However, their investigation is interrupted when a mangy, scarred wolf suddenly leaps at them.

The party engages in combat. [[El]] delivers a powerful punch to the wolf’s face. [[Grey]], wielding his hammer, lands a decisive blow, severing the creature's leg as proof for [[Mayor Eret]]. Meanwhile, [[Rue]] tracks its origins and discovers three other dead wolves, their bodies twisted unnaturally. [[Rue]] casts *Detect Magic* again and finds traces of necrotic magic in the blood.

Realizing something sinister is at play, the party builds a bonfire and burns the corpses before returning to [[Brink]] to report their findings.
# Reporting To the Mayor
Back in town, they enter [[Mayor Eret’s Office]] and drop the severed wolf leg on his desk. [[Rue]] explains what they found. The mayor listens, visibly concerned. He informs them that Brink lacks proper defenses and commissions the party for a new mission: repairing the old sky defense weapon at the [[Observatory]].

Before setting out, they head to [[The Diamond Devil]] to collect their bounty from [[Arlan]]. However, the merchant refuses to pay until the docks are reopened. After some convincing, [[El]] persuades him to hand over their reward. Each party member receives 5 gold, and they celebrate with drinks.
# The Observatory and New Discoveries
Their next destination is the Observatory, an old defense installation meant to protect [[Brink]] from aerial threats. The facility houses a large telescope and a cannon, both in a state of disrepair. [[El]], having rudimentary knowledge of such mechanisms, examines the machinery and finds a logbook detailing previous meteorite sightings. Among them, two stand out:
1. A meteor with a green trail.
2. Another unidentified anomaly.

The last entry was signed by [[Alakin]], a known scholar and astronomer who frequented [[The Diamond Devil]].

As they investigate, [[Octesian]] notices a trail of black ichor leading further into the facility. Following it, they find a large, grotesque spider, covered in the same dark ichor. Without hesitation, [[Octesian]] stabs the creature, pinning it to the floor.

[[Rue]] inspects it, but it remains unclear whether the spider was the cause of the corruption or simply a victim of it. With their list of repairs in hand, the party decides to return to town and gather the necessary materials.

Just as they exit the Observatory, alarms ring across [[Brink]], signaling the arrival of an unknown ship at the docks…

# Executive Summary
A meteorite crash near [[Brink]] sparks concern, leading the town's mayor, [[Mayor Eret]], to request an investigation. The party discovers that while the meteorite itself is mundane, the surrounding wildlife has been affected by necrotic magic. They battle and defeat a corrupted wolf before reporting their findings.

Tasked with fixing the Observatory’s sky defense weapon, they uncover records of previous meteor impacts and stumble upon a mysterious black-ichor-covered spider, hinting at a larger mystery. As they return to town, alarms blare—the docks have been unexpectedly reopened for an arriving ship…
