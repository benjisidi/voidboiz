#quest-sunlight-symphony
# Preparations in Brink
The group spends two days in [[Brink]] preparing for their journey to [[Grimlock]], a mining city near a persistent gate. Their plans include gathering supplies, securing transport, and forging documents to aid them on the trip.
# Meeting Lana
At the [[Diamond Devil]], the group meets [[Lana Skylark]], who funds their preparations with 150 gold in a locked wooden box (code: 726). She advises bringing a bottle of port, trap equipment, and potions. [[Lysander Lightfoot]] secures additional sailors for the voyage aboard the Panther.
# Grey's Forge and Viking Memories
At Grey’s cottage, the group searches for tools and mementos. Grey attempts to repair Octesian’s thieves’ tools but fails. He retrieves Goof’s shield, maps from his Viking days, and his smith’s hammer, sharing tales of his cleric training.
# The Potion Shop and a Bold Scheme
At a tea and potion shop run by an albino Tabaxi, the group negotiates for potions. Using their "fame" as leverage and proposing to reduce the shopkeeper’s tax bill, they strike a tentative deal for a discount.

To execute their plan, they decide to forge a tax document using the [[Mayor Eret]]’s stolen signature.
# Gambling and Gathering Supplies
At [[The Glass Dice]], the group secures a forgery kit and engages in light gambling. [[Oron]] provides insights about [[Grimlock]] and its mining guild, led by Dessous, a dwarf with an outsized reputation. Octesian wins 7 gold through cheating, while Grey loses 10 gold at roulette. Meanwhile, [[Rue]] and El drink fire whiskey at the bar, much to Oron’s displeasure.
# Securing a Letter of Recommendation
At the Mayor’s office, the group meets Vincent, an overworked intern. They persuade him to issue a letter of recommendation for the Grimlock mining company, with plans to use the official seal for forgery. They also collect blank official paper and medals in a fine military box.
# Magical Discoveries at Erman’s Arcana
The group visits [[Eamon’s Arcana]], a run-down magic shop with a peculiar shopkeeper. They acquire:
* A kraken tooth (purchased by Rue).
* An enchanted necklace with the symbol of Talos (bought by Grey).
* Four unique potions (Hydra Poison, Potion of Growth, Potion of Mind Reading, and Potion of Water Breathing) after Grey humorously overpays.
* A flaming sword named "Titan’s Bane," with dwarven runes and a black obsidian hilt, purchased for 13 gold.

Grey’s overpayment earns them sponsorship from [[Eamon]], branding the group as the “VOID BOIZ.” El purchases a glowing pen and secures the shopkeeper’s handwritten “business cards.”
# The Block & Pony and the Forgery
At [[The Block & Pony]], the group dines while forging the tax document. Using inspiration, El creates a perfect forgery, reducing the potion shop's tax rate by 50%. The group plans to finalize their potion purchase in the morning.
# Potion Purchase and Departure
The group returns to the potion shop, leveraging their forged tax letter and intimidation. They purchase five potions for 125 gold—a 50% discount—and celebrate their success. With supplies in hand, they prepare to set off for [[Grimlock]], their spirits high and their bond stronger.
