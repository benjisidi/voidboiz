# Rescue
We start at the [[Banero brothers]] house.

[[Eric]] leads us down a path towards the meeting point. There's a massive tree with a crudely cut symbol in its trunk. They find the same symbol in another tree in the direction of the forest path. Looks like it may be indicating a path. We follow the path into a clearing up ahead, stealthily.

[[Rue]] finds a tripwire and some traps and leads everyone away from these. We find the crumbling remains of a temple and a statue of an man with crossed legs. The statue's hands are a deep blood maroon and its legs seem stained. Inside the legs there is a basin (presumably filled with blood :( ).

They see a figure walk through the ruins and descend through some stairs in the ruins. The group decides to follow the figure through the ruins. As they walk through the ruins, they see more and more remains from the cult’s rituals.

As they reach the stairs, [[El]] uses her invisibility ring and scouts ahead. She sees the kid in a cell and a cultist guarding it.

They form a plan to take down the guard and rescue [[Peter]] quickly.

[[El]] rushes down and KOs the guard, while [[Octesian]] unlocks [[Peter]]’s cell (with a lucky ticky tick tick). Lug rushes inside and watches one of the doors. He hears a conversation and incoming footsteps.

Everyone rushes outside to get [[Peter]] out to safety first before they deal with the werewolf. Once they’re 3-5ft away they start hearing shouts and [[Peter]] stars getting tired. [[El]] carries [[Peter]] and everyone manages to get to the path towards [[Lunavesca]]. The party hears a growl from the forest and [[Peter]] runs out into safety (hopefully).
# The Battle
They hide in the forest to try and ambush the cultists as they come for the void boiz.

A group of four cultists approaches and [[Octesian]] kills one of them. [[El]] approaches the other 3 and recognises [[Garrick Durrow]].

[[Rue]] hits Garrick and he goes down (unconscious? Dead? Who knows..) . One of the cultists still alive blows on a horn (presumably to call on his allies) and runs away. Coward. [[Lug]] finishes him off.

At this point, [[Garrick Durrow]] starts actually transforming into a werewolf (oh no#). Except it’s not a werewolf, it’s a horrible devil lookalike. It heads for [[El]] and bites her, poisoning her. She shakes it off and the void boiz manage to kill all of the remaining cultists. 2 more werewolves appear.

[[Rue]] barely shoots an arrow and does just enough damage to completely wreck [[Garrick Durrow]]. She kills him as she sets his fur on fire and his charred corpse falls down.
[[Rue]] shoots at the other werewolves and they quickly retreat as they see Garrick's dead body. His body disintegrates.

[[Lug]] shames a dice into compliance and gets a Nat 20 searching the cultist's bodies.

They find the horn the cultist used before, the mask another cultist used, and a small golden pendant from Garrick. This pendant seems to have a dull, green glowing stone. A meteor shard from a meteor that landed in the woods near [[Lunavesca]]. Similar to the meteor they had found before!
