# The Mysterious Bounty Flyer
The group returns to The Squall, where they find multiple copies of a bounty flyer scattered across the room.

It reads:
> *Experienced adventurers wanted to solve a mystery most fowl. Potentially dangerous. Previous experience investigating crimes beneficial. Generous compensation available upon successful apprehension of the culprit(s).*
>
> *Interested parties please see [[Lord Erebus]] in Redcliffe Manor, Redrock.*

At the bottom, there is a wax sigil of a raven flying over a cliff.
- The paper is high-quality and waxed to protect it from the rain.
- The calligraphy is elegant, clearly written by someone with money.

The group decides Redrock will be their next stop.
- [[Rue]] is eager to get a bounty soon.
- [[Octesian]] suggests combining this job with tracking down [[Skarth Longtooth]], who also has a bounty in Redrock.
- They send word for [[The Panther]] to dock in Lunavesca, preparing for departure.
# Shopping Trip: Quip’s Quibbles
The group visits Quip’s Quibbles, a supply store run by Quip, a Lexodon merchant specializing in adventure gear.
## Purchases Using the Party Slush Fund:
- 4 Health Potions
- 2 Healer’s Kits
- [[Lug]] buys a Deck of Illusions (with only three cards left in it).
- [[Rue]] puts a 30g deposit on a Comprehend Languages potion.

They ask Quip about Redrock and learn:
- The city is entirely under pirate rule.
- There is no single ruler—just factions vying for control.

Shopping List:
✅ Health Potions
✅ Healer’s Kit
❌ Pirate outfit for [[Rue]] (tragically, they forgot)
# A Walk in the Forest and a Strange Cave
Wanting to track down [[Garrick Durrow]], they head into the forests outside Lunavesca.
- [[Rue]] follows large, clawed tracks leading deeper into the woods.
- The tracks end at the mouth of a cave.
## Investigating the Cave
- [[Rue]] sends a gecko familiar inside as a scout.
- Through its eyes, she sees:
    - Large bones scattered across the floor.
    - A straw pile that looks like a makeshift bed.
    - Pelts hung up along the walls.
    - The remnants of a small fire.
    - No sign of anyone currently inside.
- [[Lug]] searches for signs of movement but finds nothing.
- The last set of tracks go *into* the cave, but not out.

This strongly suggests that something—or someone—was here recently and hasn’t left in the usual way.
## Setting a Trap
- [[Lug]] casts Alarm at the cave entrance, ensuring they’ll be notified if anything returns.
- [[Rue]] investigates further, confirming that whoever lived here was a predator.

They strongly suspect this was [[Garrick Durrow]]’s hideout.
# Meeting with Rascal
Back in town, they seek out Rascal, a well-connected informant.
## What Rascal Tells Them About [[Garrick Durrow]]
- Garrick is a nasty piece of work.
- He has followers—practically a cult.
- They operate on the fringes of society, causing trouble but keeping just out of reach.
- For 10% of the bounty, Rascal offers to find one of his followers for them.

They agree—it’s a good lead.
# Planning the Next Steps
The group considers their next moves.
## Things to Investigate:
- Visit the Lunar Archives
    - Research lycanthropy.
    - Learn more about the followers of [[Selûne]], who might have insights.
    - Look into ways to silver their weapons.
- Follow Rascal’s lead and track down one of Garrick’s cult members.
- Prepare for their journey to Redrock.
# Executive Summary
The group finds a mysterious bounty flyer from Lord Erebus in Redrock, seeking adventurers for a high-paying investigation.

They decide to take the job, as it aligns with their plans to track down [[Skarth Longtooth]], another bounty target in Redrock.

After stocking up on supplies, they search the forests outside Lunavesca for [[Garrick Durrow]], a lycanthrope with a bounty on his head.
- They find an abandoned cave that appears to be his former hideout.
- [[Lug]] sets an Alarm spell at the entrance in case he returns.
- Rascal provides intel—Garrick has a cult-like following, and Rascal can connect them with one of his people for 10% of the bounty.

Their next steps involve visiting the Lunar Archives to learn more about lycanthropy, silvering weapons, and the followers of [[Selûne]].
## The Party now Has Multiple Objectives Ahead:
- Find the cultist and track down [[Garrick Durrow]].
- Prepare for their trip to Redrock.
- Investigate the mystery behind Lord Erebus’ request.
