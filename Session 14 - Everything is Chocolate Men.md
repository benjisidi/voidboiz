# Deciphering the [[Orrery]]
Inside [[Mystras Temple]], the group continues their exploration of a massive orrery, a celestial mechanism that seems tied to the temple’s magical defenses. The mechanism has eight planetary alignments, each connected to a plinth representing a different school of magic.

After charging a dodecahedron artifact, the group places it in the orrery’s frame, activating a puzzle on the floor. The stars in the orrery shift, revealing a series of eight divine gifts from different gods to mortals.
- [[Mystra]] – A book, later identified as [[Sunlight Symphony]]
- [[Talos]] – A chest radiating storm energy
- [[Kelemvor]] – A wand given to a single mortal
- [[Silvanus]] – A staff imbued with nature’s magic
- [[Hathor]] – A lyre of celestial music
- [[Nemesis]] – A tiara covering the wearer’s eyes
- [[Leira]] – A cloak of illusions
- [[Savras]] – A glass orb filled with swirling light

When the planets align correctly, a hidden doorway opens, revealing a hallway filled with flames.
# The Trial of Magic
Beyond the flaming passage, the group finds eight mystical plinths, each corresponding to a school of magic.
- Silver – Divination
- Dark Blue – Abjuration
- Red – Evocation
- Clear – Illusion
- Pink – Transmutation
- Gold – Enchantment
- Green – Conjuration
- Black – Necromancy

Using cantrips and enchanted items, the group activates the plinths, causing colored flames to flare up. The flames project beams of light into the main chamber, interacting with the orrery’s mechanisms.

A hidden chamber unlocks, revealing four towering glass statues, each depicting a different legendary creature.
1. A serpentine beast
2. A chitinous insectoid titan
3. A monstrous beaked entity
4. A wide-winged phoenix

A series of pulleys on the wall controls mirrors on the ceiling, redirecting light beams to specific statues. Matching the light to their corresponding elements unlocks a final passage leading to the temple’s altar room.
# The Guardian of [[Mystra’s Book]]
At the heart of the temple, the group ascends a staircase leading to a massive altar.

Atop the altar stands a kneeling statue of [[Mystra]], holding a book, presumably [[Sunlight Symphony]]. Next to it, a 25-foot-tall crystal golem activates, glowing with arcane energy.

As soon as [[El]] grabs the book, the golem awakens and unleashes a blinding flash of light, dazing the group.

[[Octesian]], staying in the shadows, avoids the blinding effect and guides the others toward the exit. [[Rue]] casts entangle, slowing the golem momentarily. [[El]], unable to fight the towering construct, sprints at full speed toward the temple’s entrance. [[Lug]] opens the book, revealing beautifully written celestial text.

As the group retreats, they feel the temple tremble. The binary stars above begin to collapse, signaling that the temple’s destruction is imminent.

In the distance, [[Lana Skylark]] yells from the ship, urging them to escape. The group makes a mad dash for the exit.
# Executive Summary
The group explores the orrery in [[Mystras Temple]], unlocking a celestial puzzle that reveals eight divine artefacts granted to mortals by various gods.

Solving the puzzle opens a flaming passageway, leading to a chamber with eight magical plinths, each tied to a school of magic. Activating these plinths triggers a light-based mechanism, illuminating four massive glass statues representing legendary creatures.

Further exploration leads to the temple’s altar, where a 25-foot-tall crystal golem guards [[Sunlight Symphony]]. The moment [[El]] grabs the book, the golem awakens and attacks.

The group fights to escape, using spells to slow the golem. [[El]] sprints away with the book while the others provide cover. The binary star system above begins to collapse, signaling the temple’s imminent destruction. The group rushes toward the exit as [[Lana Skylark]] calls from the ship.
