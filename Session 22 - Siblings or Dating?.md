# A Drink with The Viper
After spotting Seraphina, aka The Viper, lounging in Featherworths, [[Octesian]] wastes no time.
- He offers her a drink, trying to keep things casual.
- She smirks knowingly and introduces herself as a seller of reptiles—a joke that leaves Octesian immediately suspicious.
- She confirms she knows who he is. More importantly, she has a job offer.
## The Job: Stealing an Ashwyrm Egg
A rare Ashwyrm egg is arriving in Lunavesca, hidden in a crate aboard The Foxglove, a merchant ship.
- The egg is meant to be delivered to [[Featherworth]], disguised among livestock feed and crates of chickens.
- The buyer is Thornak, a well-known exotic animal trader.
- The job? Intercept the egg before it reaches its final destination.

Before Octesian can ask more, The Viper casually drops another bombshell.
## A Change in the [[Gilded Shadows]]
Symmond is now the new leader of the [[Gilded Shadows]].
- The previous leader, Eryn, has vanished.
- The guild is clearing its debts. If Octesian owes something, they’re going to collect.

He tries to mask his reaction, but The Viper clearly enjoys watching him squirm.
# A Trip to Eliana Quickshadow, the Fence
Leaving Featherworths, the group heads into the Squalls, the less reputable part of Lunavesca, to sell stolen goods and resupply.
- [[Grey]] picks up two oversized boot-steins of beer before heading to the fence.
- [[Octesian]] and [[Eliana Quickshadow]] exchange sarcastic pleasantries, and the group sells off some jewelry and loot.
- [[Grey]] gets 360 gold, and Octesian trades for three smoke bombs and two sets of thieves’ tools.
# Edgar Featherworth’s Aide Hits on El
While the group drinks at a nearby bar, Edgar, Mr. Featherworth’s aide, takes an interest in [[El]].
- He flirts aggressively, trying to get information out of her.
- She plays along but gains nothing useful.
- Edgar eventually saunters off, satisfied that he’s charming, but ultimately oblivious.
# Planning the Heist
The next morning, the group reviews their to-do list over breakfast.
- Fencing off stolen goods ✅
- Collecting Octesian’s gear from Ziri ✅
- Tracking the flame-headed [[Chantry]] agent ❌
- Waiting for the Stormcall at the church ⏳
- Investigating [[Ilbor]] and the Blacksail pirates ⏳
- Stealing the Ashwyrm egg ⏳
- Researching the end of the world ❌
## Octesian’s Equipment Pickup
They retrieve Octesian’s gear from Ziri, and while they’re there, Ziri directs them to Emberlyn, his sister, who operates a competing forge.
- Unlike her brother, Emberlyn specializes in exotic animals.
- The group buys a teacup panther (Thorn) and a puppy (Flynt) for [[Grey]].
- Ziri makes them collars and harnesses for their new companions.
# The Lunar Archives and the Changing [[Cpt. Flynn]] Scroll
The group finally makes it to the Lunar Archives, intent on researching the legend of [[Cpt. Flynn]] and the disappearing islands.
- Something about the scroll has changed, but they can’t pinpoint exactly what.
- They begin reading through various versions of the tale, searching for details.
- Hours pass in the blink of an eye. They look up and realize it’s nighttime.
- None of them remember anything they just read.

The realization sends a chill down their spines. Something is erasing knowledge of the islands.
# Executive Summary
[[Octesian]] meets with The Viper, who offers him a job: stealing an Ashwyrm egg before it reaches [[Featherworth]] and [[Thornak]].

She also reveals that the [[Gilded Shadows]] have a new leader, Symmond, and they’re clearing old debts—including Octesian’s.

The group fences stolen goods, picks up Octesian’s gear, and buys pets.

At the Lunar Archives, they try to research [[Cpt. Flynn]] and his disappearing islands—but realize that something is wiping knowledge of the islands from their memories.
