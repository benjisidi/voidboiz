# The Fight on the Rooftop
Last session ended with a hooded figure attacking [[El]] and [[Octesian]] while they inspected the damaged lightning rod.

The fight begins immediately.
- [[El]] takes a fiery dagger to the shoulder, her clothes catching alight.
- [[Octesian]] dodges a second strike, barely avoiding the flames.
- [[Lug]], still on the ground, has no idea what's happening.
## The Chase
The flame-wielding attacker is fast.
- [[El]] swings but misses.
- [[Octesian]] lands a hit, but the figure doesn’t slow down.
- [[Rue]] Misty Steps onto a nearby rooftop, cutting off their escape.

The attacker knows they’re outnumbered and leaps off the roof.
- [[Octesian]] immediately follows, rolling to his feet on the street below.
- [[El]] vaults after him, landing with precision.
- [[Rue]] turns into a panther.

The hooded figure sprints through the winding streets, but the group keeps on their tail.
# Stormcall Begins
As they run, the bells of the church start ringing.
- The Stormcall ritual is beginning.
- Dark clouds gather, lightning crackling overhead.
- The damaged lightning rod wobbles ominously in the distance.

The group doesn’t have time to worry about that right now.
# The Confrontation
The hooded figure finally stops, cornered in a narrow alley.
- The fire-wielding assassin lowers his hood, revealing the same Chantry agent from before—the one who tried to kill [[Rue]].
- He doesn’t look afraid.
- He grins, then raises his hands.

Flaming symbols appear in the air above him—an invocation to [[Kossuth]], god of fire.
- The flames form a massive sigil in the sky, visible from the entire city.
- A message, loud and clear: The [[Chantry]] is here.
# The Fight Against the [[Chantry]] Agent
The group wastes no time.
- [[Octesian]] hurls his dagger at the assassin’s chest.
- [[Lug]] fires off a bolt of lightning, the electricity crackling through the storm-filled air.
- [[El]] closes the distance in a blur of motion, striking with her staff.

The assassin fights back fiercely, throwing fireballs and slashing wildly.
- He tries to run again, but [[Rue]]—still a panther—pounces and knocks him to the ground.
- [[Octesian]] finishes it with a well-placed crowbar to the back of the head, knocking him unconscious.
# Tying Him Up (Literally)
With the Chantry agent finally captured, they bind his hands and gag him to stop him from casting spells.

A quick search of his belongings reveals:
- A hidden dagger soaked in poison.
- A small notebook, half-burned.
- Two explosive potions.
# Stormcall Goes Wrong
As they secure their prisoner, the sky rumbles ominously.

The Stormcall ritual reaches its peak—and something is very wrong.
- The lightning rod atop the church shudders.
- A bolt of lightning strikes, and the rod partially collapses.
- Instead of directing the storm’s energy safely, the magic goes wild.

Lightning begins striking random buildings, setting parts of the city ablaze.
# Rushing to the Church
The group drags their unconscious prisoner with them and rushes to the Storm Church, where [[Vaelen Windsinger]] is desperately trying to control the situation.
- He looks horrified when they present the bound assassin.
- [[Octesian]] tosses the assassin at his feet.
- [[Rue]] tells him about the lightning rod—someone tampered with it.
# Executive Summary
The group chases down and captures the [[Chantry]] agent responsible for sabotaging the Stormcall.

Just as they subdue him, the ritual spirals out of control, with lightning strikes setting the city on fire.

They rush to the church, where [[Vaelen Windsinger]] sees the bound assassin and realizes the [[Chantry]] had infiltrated Lunavesca.
