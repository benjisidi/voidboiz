#quest-stormcall
# The Aftermath of the Stormcall Sabotage
The city is in chaos.
- Lightning continues to strike at random, setting buildings ablaze.
- Panicked civilians flee, while members of the Storm Church try desperately to restore order.
- Vaelen Windsinger, head of the church, is stunned as the group presents him with the bound [[Chantry]] agent.

They don’t have time to explain everything. The priority is stopping the storm from destroying Lunavesca.
# Fire and Rescue Efforts
The group splits up to help save the city while Vaelen attempts to stabilize the Stormcall ritual.
- [[Rue]] summons water magic to douse flames, extinguishing a burning house.
- [[Lug]] rescues a group of trapped civilians from a collapsing building.
- [[Octesian]]—against all odds—runs into a burning shop to save someone.
    - He pulls the woman out, but both take serious injuries.
    - He drags her to safety, but she dies before he can get her medical help.
    - For once, he is visibly shaken.
# A Fiery Revelation
As they regroup near the church, they spot something horrifying.
- The flaming sigil in the sky, created by the [[Chantry]] agent, remains burning above the city.
- As the group watches, a shape forms in the flames—an image of a skull, wreathed in fire.
- [[Rue]] and [[Lug]] immediately recognize it as the mark of [[Kossuth]], god of fire.

Then, from the shadows, they see him.

The flame-headed assassin—the one they captured—stands atop a nearby building.

But he is supposed to be tied up.
# The Chase Continues
- [[El]] and [[Octesian]] immediately sprint after him.
- [[Rue]] shapeshifts into a panther again, leaping across rooftops.
- [[Lug]] follows on foot, trying to cut off escape routes.
# The Final Confrontation
The assassin is not running this time. He stands, chanting in a low voice, flames swirling around him.
- A massive fireball erupts from his hands, forcing the group to scatter.
- [[El]] is the first to reach him, striking with her staff.
- [[Octesian]] follows up, a well-placed blow sending the assassin staggering.
# Knocking Him Out…Again
The assassin tries to escape once more, but they don’t let him.
- [[Rue]] pounces, pinning him down.
- [[Lug]] finally lands a clean shot, knocking him unconscious.
- This time, they make extra sure he is bound, gagged, and incapable of casting.
# The Interrogation and a Costly Mistake
They take their prisoner to a secure location near the church while [[Octesian]] fetches [[Vaelen Windsinger]].
- Vaelen is horrified to see the symbol of [[Kossuth]] hanging over the city.
- He immediately recognizes the prisoner’s tattoos and markings as those of the [[Chantry]].

They search the assassin’s belongings again. This time, they find a locked chest.
- It radiates strong magic.
- [[Rue]] casts Detect Magic, identifying an explosive trap set to incinerate its contents if opened incorrectly.
- [[Octesian]] finds a key and carefully unlocks it.
- The chest still explodes.

Inside were important documents—but now they are nothing but ash.
# What Little They Salvage
Among the burnt remnants, they manage to recover:
- Sketches of a book—possibly a relic connected to the [[Chantry]].
- A small portion of a schematic of the church.

But most of the information is lost.
# Executive Summary
The storm continues to rage as the group fights to save Lunavesca from the fallout of the [[Chantry]] sabotage.
- They put out fires, rescue civilians, and try to mitigate the destruction.
- The captured [[Chantry]] agent somehow escapes and reveals himself again in the city.
- The group chases him down and knocks him out—again.
- Interrogating him proves difficult, and a locked chest they recover explodes, destroying critical information.
- All they manage to salvage are sketches of a book and a fragment of a schematic related to the church.

The city is still in chaos, and now, the symbol of [[Kossuth]] looms over Lunavesca like a warning.
