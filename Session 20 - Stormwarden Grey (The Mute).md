# Exploring the Market District
The group spends the morning navigating the bustling markets of Lunavesca, each searching for different things.

[[Grey]] and [[Lug]] visit the Gleam Gem Store, where:
- [[Grey]] buys a small gem on a necklace, possibly for magic or sentimental value.
- [[Lug]] inquires about places that deal in maps and is directed to the Lunar Archive.

Meanwhile, [[El]], [[Rue]], and [[Octesian]] head to the weapons district.
- They stumble upon a street performer juggling knives and torches.
- [[Octesian]] immediately scans the crowd for a pickpocketing target—it does not go well.
- The victim (a large bearded man) spots him and begins to chase. [[Octesian]] vanishes into the crowd, leaving the others to cover for him.
- [[Rue]] uses Mold Earth to trip the juggler, but he regains his balance and keeps pursuing.
- [[Octesian]] escapes, ducking under a bolt of cloth being carried by a merchant.

They continue their shopping, eventually reaching a forge run by a massive half-orc named Ziri.
- [[Octesian]] tries to haggle for a returning dagger, but fails miserably.
- [[El]] asks about staffs, but Ziri does not care for them - triggers El
- She takes him down swiping her staff under his legs
	- He points out he still has his legs

[[Rue]] notices cages stacked near the market entrance, containing various exotic creatures.
- The merchant, Thornak, is a towering beast of a man who does not carry business cards.
- He mentions having an Ash Wyrm egg, an extremely rare find.
- [[El]] subtly challenges him, claiming she heard he couldn’t get the best creatures.
- Thornak becomes immediately suspicious and demands to know who has been spreading these rumors.
# The Storm Church of [[Talos]]
With their shopping done, the group regroups and discusses their next moves. [[Grey]] wants to investigate the lightning-forged metal used in the church, but they need a way to get inside without suspicion.

Several plans are proposed:
- [[Grey]] pretends to be a mute monk, joining the order.
- Someone seduces a cleric for access.
- "Shenanigans."

They settle on Grey going undercover.

Upon entering the Storm Church, they find it filled with ornate carvings of storms and warriors. Clergy members in ceremonial robes move about, preparing for the upcoming Stormcall ritual.
- [[Octesian]] introduces [[Grey]] to one of the priests, convincing them that he is a dedicated but silent follower of [[Talos]].
- The priest accepts him and introduces him to [[Skykeeper Weston]], the second-in-command of the church.

They also notice a middle-aged man in burnt-orange robes, with a grizzled face and unshaven beard. He is deeply engrossed in studying a large tome.

[[Rue]] sneaks closer and sees that the man’s robe has the mark of the [[Chantry]]—the flaming crown tattoo.
# The Archives and the Stormcall Ritual
The priest leads [[Grey]], [[Rue]], and [[Octesian]] to the church’s archives, where they meet another priest, Western, who provides them with a tour of the sacred relics.

Among the relics, [[Lug]] spots a large book with a golden hourglass on the cover—the symbol of [[Kelemvor]], god of time and the dead.

The book contains a passage on the Rod of Moments, an artifact said to have been entrusted to the Guardians of the Eternal Veil. It describes trials designed to test one’s worthiness, known as the Trials of Dusk.
- The trials are said to judge a person’s understanding of life, death, and time.
- It warns that misuse of the artifact can lead to dangerous consequences, including time loops and accidental crossings into the realm of the dead.
# Examining the church’s Lightning Rod
As the group prepares to leave, [[Grey]] and [[El]] ask about the upcoming Stormcall.
- They learn that the ceremony involves channeling [[Talos]]’ power through the city’s massive lightning rod, which is crucial for protecting Lunavesca during the storm.
- Without it, the storm would rage uncontrollably, potentially devastating the city.

Suspicious, the group decides to examine the rod themselves.
# The Climb to the Rooftop
Late at night, [[El]], [[Lug]], and [[Octesian]] sneak back to the church.
- [[Lug]] uses his mason’s tools to analyze the structure, finding a perfect climbing route.
- [[El]] races ahead but struggles midway.
- [[Lug]] and [[Octesian]] reach the top, spotting the massive lightning rod standing over 20 feet tall.

Upon closer inspection, they find deep scratches along its surface—marks that don’t seem natural.

Just as [[El]] is boosting herself up to examine it further, a hooded figure dashes across the rooftop.

The figure draws a blade wreathed in fire and swings at [[El]], setting her shoulder ablaze.
# Executive Summary
The group explores the markets of Lunavesca, learning about the city’s upcoming Stormcall ritual and the strange lightning-forged material called Gleamstone.

They investigate the Storm Church of [[Talos]], with [[Grey]] posing as a mute monk. They discover:
- A mysterious man in burnt-orange robes, later identified as a member of the [[Chantry]].
- A book on the Rod of Moments, revealing that it is hidden behind trials testing worthiness in the realm of time and death.

Suspicious of the Stormcall ritual, the group sneaks back to examine the church’s lightning rod and finds deep scratches along its surface. Before they can investigate further, a hooded figure attacks, wielding a blade of fire.
