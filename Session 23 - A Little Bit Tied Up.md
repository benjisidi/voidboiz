# The Lunar Archives and the Flynn Mystery
After their previous unsettling experience at the Lunar Archives, the group returns, determined to crack the mystery of [[Cpt. Flynn]] and the disappearing islands.
- They wake up in the library, hours after having entered, unable to remember anything they read.
- Every time they attempt to study the Flynn books, they go catatonic—as if something is actively erasing the knowledge.
- [[El]] tests a theory by watching [[Lug]] read aloud while covering his lips—he keeps reading to the end, but no one remembers what he said.
- [[Octesian]] gets bored and starts looking at old manuscripts and maps instead.

The group decides on a new plan:
1. Find [[Thoric Darkmantle]], the scholar who donated the Flynn books to the archive.
2. Confirm their theory: whoever has looked at the map cannot read the fables.
# The Assassination Attempt
On the way back to The Polished Tree, [[Rue]] suddenly staggers, clutching her side.

A poisoned dart sticks out of her shoulder.
- [[Octesian]], [[Lug]], and [[El]] immediately give chase as a hooded figure darts across the rooftops.
- [[El]] tries to vault up to the roof but loses her grip, landing hard on the ground.
- [[Lug]] Misty Steps onto the roof.
- [[Octesian]] scrambles up, dagger in hand, and immediately shouts: “Hello, idiot.”

Meanwhile, [[Rue]] heals herself, but is still weakened by the poison. She summons a fey owl named Dahvid to track their attacker.
- [[Octesian]] throws a dagger into the assassin’s back—his plan is to track it with Locate Object later. The DM lets him think this is a great idea.
- The assassin retaliates with fire magic, sending a burning blast at [[Octesian]] and [[El]].
- [[El]] catches another dart mid-air and throws it back at the assassin, hitting him.
- The assassin throws a bolas, entangling both [[Octesian]] and [[El]].
- The fight turns into a chase. [[Rue]] watches through Dahvid’s eyes, tracking their prey.
# The Assassin Escapes
- [[Octesian]] cuts himself free, cursing.
- [[Lug]] pulls out a small mechanical cutting tool and frees [[Octesian]].
- The assassin throws a smoke bomb, obscuring the rooftops.
- [[Rue]] sees him for a brief moment before Dahvid is burned from the sky.
- The assassin vanishes into the night.

[[Octesian]] growls, “No one ties me up and doesn’t call me after.”
The group is left shaken—this wasn’t just a random attack.
# Who Was the Assassin?
- [[El]] and [[Octesian]] recognize him—he was the flame-marked man from the Storm Church.
- He was one of the [[Chantry]] members infiltrating Lunavesca.
- But why was he after [[Rue]]?
# Breakfast and New Plans
The group wakes up tense.
- [[Rue]] aggressively questions whether or not she’s allergic to peanuts.
- [[Lug]] eats an entire pile of eggs.
- [[Grey]] is still asleep.
- [[Octesian]] insists on a full breakdown of what’s for breakfast.

They review their next moves:
- Find [[Thoric Darkmantle]] and ask about the Flynn books.
- Follow up on the [[Chantry]] and their plans.
- Locate the pirate [[Ilbor]] and learn more about the Blacksail Consortium.
- Figure out who sent the assassin.
# Visiting The Platinum Pot
The group decides to check in at The Platinum Pot, another high-end tavern.
- The owner, Hef, is a larger-than-life showman with absolutely no filter.
- Hef is immediately suspicious of them but allows them to book rooms.
- There is a fighting ring in the tavern, and [[El]] pretends to be an amateur fighter to enter a match.
- The main event for the night is Mollie The Bruiser vs. Regulus.
# Meeting Dizzy Rascal
In the basement of The Platinum Pot, they meet Dizzy Rascal, a scarred tabaxi with two pistols and a rough demeanor.
- He confirms that the clerics at the archives hunt werewolves.
- He knows nothing about the [[Chantry]] but suggests they investigate the docks.
- He shares rumors about [[Ilbor]], calling him reckless, even for a pirate.
- [[Octesian]] asks for information on Greyhaven. Dizzy will provide it—for a price.
# What the Group Learned About the [[Chantry]]
[[Lug]] pieces together some crucial information about the [[Chantry]].
- They originated from the Elysian Empire, worshipping holy stars.
- They became a radical splinter group, accusing the Empire of heresy for not purging nonbelievers from sacred sites.
- They are violently expansionist, believing all stars belong to them.
# Executive Summary
The group investigates the Lunar Archives again but still cannot retain any knowledge of [[Cpt. Flynn]]’s story. They decide to seek out [[Thoric Darkmantle]] for answers.

On their way home, [[Rue]] is attacked by a [[Chantry]] assassin, but the group fights him off. He escapes, but they confirm he was the flame-marked man from the church.

The next day, they:
- Discuss peanut allergies and eat an alarming number of eggs.
- Check into The Platinum Pot, where [[El]] signs up for a fighting match.
- Meet [[Dizzy Rascal]], who provides intel on the [[Chantry]] and the pirate [[Ilbor]].
- Confirm that the [[Chantry]] is an extreme faction that violently claims stars as their birthright.

They now have three leads:
1. Find [[Thoric Darkmantle]] to understand the Flynn mystery.
2. Investigate the docks to learn about the [[Chantry]]’s movements.
3. Track down the pirate [[Ilbor]] and the Blacksail Consortium.
