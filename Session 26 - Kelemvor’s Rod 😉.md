# The Gilded Shadows and Octesian’s Debt
The session starts with a very tense conversation at The Platinum Pot.
- [[Octesian]] finally admits that he was never officially initiated into the [[Gilded Shadows]]—he was just someone who “helped out.”
- This “helping out” involved abandoning his previous crew mid-mission, letting them get arrested while he escaped.
- Whatever debt he owes, it’s not just about money.
- There are at least three people in the guild who have a personal grudge against him—a Half-Orc, a Kenku, and a Tiefling.
- [[Rue]] is very unimpressed.

Meanwhile, the group discusses how to gain access to the Storm Church’s relics.
## The Best Plans They Come Up With:
- Plan A: [[Grey]] pretends to be a mute monk and infiltrates the church.
- Plan B: Someone seduces a priest for information.
- Plan C: General shenanigans.

They decide to head to the church archives and see what they can find.
# The Storm Church of [[Talos]]
The church is busy preparing for the upcoming Stormcall ritual, so security is tighter than usual.
- [[Octesian]] gives a rousing speech (mostly to himself), hyping up their “undercover mission.”
- A random blacksmith hammering away next door tells them it’s about lunchtime.
- They decide to act like religious visitors to blend in.

Inside the church, they meet [[Windsinger Vaelen]], the high priest.
- [[El]] asks if she can access the archives but fails to convince him.
- Instead, she gets a 10-minute lecture on faith, which she nods along to politely.
# Breaking into the Archives
Since the diplomatic approach isn’t working, [[Lug]] decides to go for “reckless improvisation.”
- He waits until no one is looking, then “accidentally” falls down the stairs into the lower levels.
- This is not subtle.
- Clergy members immediately notice a small, round man tumbling into their sacred vault.
- [[Lug]] casts Disguise Self, transforming into an elderly man in armor.
- A young acolyte approaches him, confused, and asks if he needs help.
- [[Lug]] bluffs his way through, claiming he is looking for a book about relics.

To his surprise, the acolyte doesn’t question it and starts giving him a tour.
# Finding the Rod of Moments
During the tour, [[Lug]] spots a book with a golden hourglass—the symbol of [[Kelemvor]], god of time and death.

Inside, he finds an entry about the Rod of Moments.
- A powerful artifact that grants control over time and the passage between life and death.
- It was given to a sect called the Guardians of the Eternal Veil, who locked it away behind trials to test worthiness.
- The trials are called the Trials of Dusk.
- Past misuse of the rod resulted in disastrous consequences, including time loops and breaches into the afterlife.
- It was hidden in the Vault of Echoes.

The group immediately wants it.
# Checking the Lightning Rod
While [[Lug]] finishes his “tour” of the archives, [[El]] and [[Octesian]] sneak off to check the lightning rod.
- With the upcoming Stormcall, they suspect sabotage.
- They climb to the church rooftop, carefully avoiding attention.
- The lightning rod is massive—three feet wide and extending twenty feet into the air.

After close inspection, they find deep scratches along its base.
- Something—or someone—has tampered with it.
- It looks unstable.
- If it fails during the Stormcall, the entire city could be in danger.

Just as [[El]] starts climbing higher for a better look, a hooded figure rushes across the rooftop.
- The figure draws a dagger wreathed in fire and slashes at [[El]], setting her ablaze.
- Combat begins.
# Executive Summary
- [[Octesian]] finally admits that he abandoned his old crew in the [[Gilded Shadows]], and now they want payback.
- [[Lug]] bluffs his way into the Storm Church archives, disguised as an old man.
- They discover the Rod of Moments, an artifact that can manipulate time but is locked away in the Vault of Echoes.
- [[El]] and [[Octesian]] sneak onto the church rooftop and discover that the lightning rod has been tampered with.
- Before they can investigate further, a hooded figure attacks, wielding a blade of fire.
