# Description
A massive cathedral occupying a meteor-like island in the astral sea. The temple contains divine carvings depicting the creation of the astral plane, the titans’ imprisonment, and the battle between gods, mortals, and demons. The group discovers that the temple’s mechanisms and carvings are tied to ancient myths and the relic they seek.
