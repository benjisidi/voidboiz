#quest-stormcall
# Reviewing the To-Do List
The group goes over their ongoing list of objectives while eating breakfast at The Platinum Pot.
- Steal the Ashwyrm egg ✅ (happening today)
- El’s upcoming fight ⏳
- Wait for the Stormcall at the church ⏳
- Investigate the [[Chantry]]—who sent the assassin? ⏳
- Research the end of the world and track the eight relics ⏳

Meanwhile, [[Octesian]] seems… distracted.
# The Gilded Shadows Problem
[[Octesian]] has a debt to the [[Gilded Shadows]], and he knows they’ll come collecting sooner or later.
- [[The Viper]] confirmed that Symmond is now leading the guild after Eryn vanished.
- Octesian is hesitant to share exactly what he owes.
- He abandons his usual bravado for a rare moment of actual concern.

Meanwhile, [[El]] reveals that she might have people looking for her. She doesn’t know for sure, but she gets the feeling.
# The Heist: Stealing the Ashwyrm Egg
A large crate arrives at the tavern that morning, filled with dock worker uniforms.
- The outfits fit too well, making them immediately suspicious.
- They also include matching caps.

The group puts them on and heads for the docks.

On the way, they’re stopped by [[Hemlock]], their usual transport guy, eating a breakfast burrito.
- He warns them not to mess with [[Featherworth]].
- If things go south, he knows nothing.
- He asks if they actually have a buyer lined up.

This leads to a very long conversation about their options.
- [[Octesian]] is worried about how much [[The Viper]] knows about him.
- There’s some personal pride involved—he already agreed to do the job.
- He also really, really wants a snake.

Ultimately, they decide to proceed with the heist.
# Scouting The Foxglove at the Docks
Arriving at the dock tavern, The Blue Goliath, the group begins gathering intel.

They meet Ruth, a dock worker wearing the same uniform as them.
- [[El]] befriends Ruth over drinks and sandwiches.
- [[Rue]] tries to bond with Ruth but accidentally reveals she’s from the Material Plane, causing a stir.
- [[Octesian]] attempts to start a revolution among the dock workers. He fails.
- [[El]] buys everyone a round of drinks, ensuring that everyone now notices the three new “dock workers.”

Realizing they’ve drawn way too much attention, [[El]] pretends to be drunk, giving them an excuse to leave.

They wait near the docks until The Foxglove arrives.
# The Warehouse Heist
The group joins the other dock workers as a large Minotaur captain yells at them to start unloading.
- [[Rue]] casts Locate Object, summoning a magical snake to track the egg.
- The spell points directly toward the hold.
- They blend in with the workers, carrying crates back and forth.

Eventually, they identify the exact crate.

They carry it into the warehouse, pretending to store it properly, while discussing how to get it out.
- Walking out with it might be too obvious.
- Causing a distraction might be better.

Meanwhile, [[El]] spots some very expensive barrels of wine in the warehouse.
- She pockets a bottle of port for later.
# The Escape Plan
As their shift comes to an end, they decide on a simple plan.
- Pick up the egg crate as if they were moving it to another storage area.
- Cover it with cloth.
- Make it look natural.

[[El]] creates a distraction by knocking over a box of lemons, sending them rolling across the dock.
- [[Rue]] and [[Octesian]] use the distraction to slip away with the crate.
- They head down a side alley, away from prying eyes.
# Getting the Egg to Safety
Now out of sight, they need to transport the egg to The Platinum Pot.
- [[Octesian]] flags down a passing cab.
- The cab driver is an incredibly annoying child.
- [[Rue]] casts Reduce on the egg, shrinking it just enough to fit into the cab.

The kid immediately asks too many questions about what they’re carrying.
- [[Octesian]] pays him extra to shut up.
- It does not work.

Eventually, they arrive at the tavern.
# The Aftermath
Back at the docks, [[El]] returns to find her friends missing.
- She notices an empty crate, straw scattered around it.
- She realizes what happened and carries the crate back inside.
- While doing so, she notices two small silver sigils on the crate.
- She carefully removes them with a pen knife.
- For good measure, she moves one of them to a different box.

Now that the job is done, she heads to The Platinum Pot for a drink.
- She runs into Ruth again, who is taking a break from work.
- She tells Ruth, “See you tomorrow!”
- …So now they have to go back to the docks again.
# Meeting The Viper
With the egg secure, [[Octesian]] heads to Featherworths to inform The Viper that the job is done.

Upon returning to his room at The Platinum Pot, he finds her already there, waiting.
- [[El]] and [[Rue]] immediately decide to eavesdrop.
- [[Rue]] sends a spider familiar into the room.

Inside, The Viper gets straight to business.
- She knows Octesian’s past.
- She knows the [[Gilded Shadows]] are after him.
- Someone, at some point, is coming to collect his debt.

For a moment, the tension is thick.

Then—flirting.

The conversation takes an unexpectedly charged turn.

[[Rue]] and [[El]] choose this exact moment to break down the door, holding the egg.
- The Viper looks entirely unimpressed.
- They exchange the egg for 500 gold.
- She disappears into the night.
# The Slush Fund
With the job complete, they pool their money into a group slush fund.
- Everyone contributes 50 gold.
- Except [[Rue]], who contributes 53 to make her wallet an even number.
# Executive Summary
The group successfully steals the Ashwyrm egg from The Foxglove using dock worker disguises and a well-timed lemon spill distraction.

They transport the egg via carriage and deliver it to The Viper, earning 500 gold.

Meanwhile, [[Octesian]] learns that his past is catching up with him, and [[El]] accidentally ensures they’ll have to return to the docks the next day.
