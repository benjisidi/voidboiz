# The Battle Continues
The VOID BOIZ continue their battle against the massive stone titans animated from the walls of Mystra’s Temple:
* [[Rue]] fires arrows and starfire, while [[Lug]] delivers a powerful backhand, bringing down the basilisk-like serpent.
* [[Octesian]] and [[El]] engage the chimera-like creature, delivering a flurry of punches and stabs to take it down.
* [[Lug]] faces the poisonous insect-like titan but gets grappled and covered in acid. He uses his magic to escape.
* The insect titan pursues, spewing acid on [[Rue]], [[Grey]], and [[Lug]] as they line up. [[El]] rushes in, landing a devastating blow.
* [[Grey]] finishes the battle with a toll the dead spell, causing the final titan to vibrate apart.

As the group rests briefly, flames erupt from the walls, and skeletons and zombies emerge.
# Fire and Bones
The group faces waves of undead enemies amidst the flames:
* [[Rue]] shatters the first skeleton with a well-placed shot, but the undead begin to rise again after being struck down.
* After initial panic, the group regains control, systematically destroying the undead as they emerge.
* With a final strike, [[El]] brings down the last undead, and the flames subside.
# Onward and Inward
The flames recede, leaving the room silent. The party proceeds deeper into the temple:
* [[El]] opens the once-locked door at the end of the room, revealing a hexagonal chamber containing a massive orrery. At its center is a dodecahedron within a copper plinth.
* Exploring side rooms:
    * To the left, they find a hallway with intricately carved walls and stained glass windows. A lens at the far end channels light into a focused beam.
    * To the right, they encounter a dark room where light seems to vanish. [[El]] uses her quarterstaff lamp to test the room, but the light is extinguished upon entering.
# The Orrery and the Beacon
The group investigates the main room and the mechanisms:
* [[Lug]] discovers keyholes in the plinth holding the dodecahedron.
* They lift a massive glass object from the main room and bring it to the light-filled hallway, charging it with energy from the beam.
* Returning the charged glass to the main room, they discover it casts dramatic shadows but doesn’t interact with the mechanism as expected.
* [[Grey]] carries the charged glass into the dark room, pushing through necrotic shadows of gaping mouths and grasping hands. The light dims as he advances.
* At the end of the dark room, Grey finds a plinth with two jet-black keys. He places the glass beacon down to pick up the keys, but struggles to retrieve the beacon afterward.
* As Grey returns, the light in the beacon fades entirely, and necrotic hands rake against him, causing significant damage.

The session ends with the group regrouping and planning their next steps.
