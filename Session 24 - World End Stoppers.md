#quest-stormcall
# Reviewing the To-Do List
The group gathers in The Platinum Pot to sort through their ever-growing list of problems.
- Steal the Ashwyrm egg ✅ (in progress)
- El’s upcoming fight ⏳
- Wait for the Stormcall at the church ⏳
- Investigate the [[Chantry]]—who sent the assassin? ⏳
- Track down and research the eight relics ⏳
- Find out how to stop the end of the world ⏳

On top of that, they need to visit [[Thoric Darkmantle]] to follow up on the Flynn mystery.
# A Ride to the Docks
Before heading to the docks, [[Octesian]] discreetly asks their informant, Dizzy Rascal, to search for a Tiefling named [[Argo]] in Greyhaven.

As they walk, a cart clatters past them, driven by their usual transport guy, [[Hemlock]].
- [[Hemlock]] grins and offers them a ride.
- On the way, he casually drops a bombshell—there’s a decoy Ashwyrm egg on the ship.
- The real one is ice cold to the touch because Ashwyrm eggs suck in heat.

[[Hemlock]] also agrees to source them some dock worker uniforms and crates, as requested by [[Grey]].
# The Foxglove and The Plan
The group arrives at the docks and tracks the arrival of The Foxglove.
- The ship is due to arrive at Pier Trois just past midday.
- [[Lug]] assesses where the egg is likely stored and confirms it will be in a shared warehouse.
- [[Thornak]], the exotic animal trader, is overseeing the cargo.
- They plan to intercept the egg as soon as possible.
# A Quick Detour to [[Thoric Darkmantle]]
Before executing the heist, the group tracks down Thoric Darkmantle at his dusty, cluttered shop.
- [[Grey]] speaks to him in Dwarvish.
- [[Thoric]] inspects a gold bird statue and offers [[Lug]] 50 gold for it. [[El]] nods in approval, so [[Lug]] happily takes the deal.
## The Flynn Investigation
The group pushes [[Thoric]] for more details on the Flynn books.
- [[Thoric]] confirms that the story erases itself from the reader’s memory.
- The more detail someone learns, the faster it disappears.
- [[Thoric]]’s theory: The island itself is enchanted.
## The Blacksail Consortium
The group asks about Flynn’s connection to pirates.
- Flynn founded a group called the Blacksail Consortium.
- They follow his charter to the letter, but no one remembers what’s written in it.
- The nine most powerful pirate captains lead the Consortium, the most infamous being [[Ilbor]].
- They sail out of Redrock Cove.

The group realizes they will need to track down the Blacksail if they ever want to find Flynn’s island.
# The Eight Relics
Since [[Thoric]] is an expert on ancient fables and artifacts, the group also asks about the relics.
- [[Kelemvor]]’s Wand, the [[Rod of Moments]]: Controls time, allows travel to and from the land of the dead.
- [[Talos]]’ chest, the [[Arc of Storms]]: Can control currents and summon storms.
- [[Mystra]]’s tome, the [[Sunlight Symphony]]: The book of magic and divine knowledge. *We have this one.*
- [[Silvanus]]’ Staff, a branch of the World Tree: Grants immense control over nature.
- [[Nemesis]]’ tiara, [[Diadem of Truth]]: Allows the wearer to see through lies and illusions.
- [[Leira]]’s Cloak of Lies: Renders the wearer invisible to enemies.
- [[Savras]]’ Orb of Foresight: Grants visions of the future.
- [[Hathor]]’s Lyre: Can warp reality through music.

Thoric warns them: Tracking these down will be no easy feat.
# Back to the Docks
With their heist gear secured and their intel gathered, the group gears up to steal the Ashwyrm egg.
## Egg Description:
- Dark grey-blue with scale-like etchings.
- Ice cold to the touch.
- About the size of a large barrel.

They don their stolen dock worker uniforms and prepare to pull off the job.
# Executive Summary
The group finalizes their plan to steal the Ashwyrm egg from The Foxglove, learning that there’s a decoy egg on board.

They meet with [[Thoric Darkmantle]], who confirms that knowledge of [[Cpt. Flynn]]’s island erases itself. He shares theories about the Blacksail Consortium and their mysterious charter.

They also gather crucial information about the eight relics, realizing they’ll need to track them down to prevent the end of the world.

With their disguises ready, they head to the docks to steal the egg.
