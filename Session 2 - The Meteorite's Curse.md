# Executive Summary
The party rushes to aid the people of [[Brink]] as undead creatures attack the town. They battle a mounted undead warrior before spotting hundreds more approaching from the woods.

A [[Syndicate Navy Ship]] arrives, bombarding the undead with cannon fire. [[Lana Skylark]], the ship’s commander and a disgraced former admiral, orders the party to investigate the fallen meteorite.

Following a trail from the crater, the group reaches [[Malarwin’s Farm]], where they find the reclusive farmer dead, clutching a glowing green stone from the meteorite. The artifact exerts a strange compulsion, making people unwilling to part with it. To contain it, they seal it inside a cast-iron frying pan.

Their investigation is interrupted by a masked attacker and the resurrected corpse of Malarwin, both seemingly drawn to the glowing green stone. [[Rue]] instantly kills Malarwin with an ice knife, while the rest of the group battles the masked man—who, like Malarwin, also reanimates.

The party ultimately destroys him, but they are left with unanswered questions about the meteorite’s power and the rising undead threat.
## Chaos in [[Brink]]
The group moves toward the sounds of screaming as the townsfolk of [[Brink]] flee in terror. As they arrive at the source of the commotion, they spot an undead soldier, clad in decaying armor, riding an undead horse through the streets.

Without hesitation, the party leaps into action. [[Grey]] calls down divine energy to smite the creature, and [[El]] engages in close combat. [[Octesian]] sneaks into position to deliver a decisive strike. [[Rue]] and [[Lug]] support the battle from a distance, using magic and ranged attacks. The battle ends with the undead creatures slain.

As the dust settles, the team looks to the horizon, where hundreds more creatures emerge from the treeline, advancing toward the town.

## The [[Syndicate Navy Ship]] Intervenes
Just as panic begins to take hold, the sound of cannons firing echoes through the town. A ship offshore is bombarding the undead, keeping them at bay. [[Octesian]] recognizes the ship as part of the [[Syndicate Navy]], but more notably, [[El]] identifies the commanding officer: [[Lana Skylark]], a former admiral with a scandalous past.

Stripped of her rank, [[Lana Skylark]] now operates independently, but she still commands a sense of authority. She demands answers from the party about the nature of the undead attack. Upon learning of the fallen meteorite, she orders them to investigate its source.

Despite attempts by [[Rue]] and [[Octesian]] to recruit a guard for assistance, the soldier refuses, citing orders to remain in [[Brink]].

## The Journey to [[Malarwin’s Farm]]
Following the signs of destruction, the team ventures toward the impact site of the meteorite. [[El]] notices a trail of footprints leading away from the crater, veering toward an isolated farmstead.

The group recalls that the farm belongs to [[Malarwin]], an elderly, reclusive man known only for selling produce in town. With caution, they approach the farmhouse and knock on the door. There is no response.

[[Grey]], never one for patience, smashes open the door with his hammer. Inside, they find Malarwin’s lifeless body, slumped over and clutching a glowing green stone. The eerie glow matches the meteorite fragment.

## The Cursed [[Meteorite Fragment]]
As they investigate, [[Octesian]] attempts to remove the glowing green stone from [[Malarwin]]’s grasp, only to feel a sudden compulsion to keep it for herself. [[El]] quickly takes it from her, only to feel the same obsession creep into her mind.

Sensing the danger, [[Grey]] uses divine magic to protect [[El]] while they work to safely contain the artifact. The group decides to place it inside a cast-iron frying pan, which [[Grey]] hammers shut, sealing the mysterious meteorite fragment.

Before they can discuss their next move, something flies across the sky and crashes into the ground outside.

## The [[Masked Man]] and [[Malarwin’s Farm]] Awakens
A figure in a mask emerges from the impact, wielding a weapon and moving aggressively toward the group. Before they can react, [[Malarwin]]—who had been dead only moments ago—rises as an undead monstrosity.

[[Rue]] wastes no time, summoning an ice knife that impales [[Malarwin]], killing him again in an instant. The rest of the group turns their attention to the masked attacker, engaging him in battle.

Despite his defeat, the masked man also rises from the dead, now fixated on retrieving the cast-iron pan containing the meteorite shard. He lunges toward [[Lug]], but the group fights him off and ultimately destroys him.

With the immediate threat eliminated, they take a moment to breathe. [[Rue]]—having felled [[Malarwin]] in a single attack—silently cements her self-proclaimed legendary status (her "Rue-tation," as she later calls it).

With the glowing green stone still an enigma and the undead growing in numbers, the party knows their problems are far from over...
