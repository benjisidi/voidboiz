# The First Entry
The void boiz are invited into the home by a green warforged man ([[Baxter]]). They are led into the foyer where they wait a bit, and then get led into a room with a big split stairwell and then a side room.
We meet a human man ([[Lord Erebus]]), in his 40s, drinking out of a porcelain cup and he explains the quest
## A Quest Most Fowl
A couple of people have been murdered:
- Lady Blackmarch - while she was at a function at a ballroom (Barrington's Ball) (body mysteriously found) (stabbed) - Lord Erebus was at the same function
	- Both Blackmarch and [[Lord Erebus]] are both collectors (of rare artifacts)
- The lady's maid (Sabine) was found dead in her kitchen (house on the cliffside) - Found the maid a day or so later
- Well known tramp (Monty) was found dead in Leviathan's Shadow (underground market) - Found a day or so later
- Other suspect is Bower (tiefling) - but suspicions are racist
### Rewards
- **300 GP** each + expenses + lodging + cash from Baxter - for investigating at all
- **200 GP** each - for finding out who did it
- **everything in the vault** - if we can prove the lord did it (we don't think he did it)
# Investigation Continues
- Lug is really curious as to how you become a collector
- The void boiz accept and get a silver scroll that details the employment - the contract
- Everyone signs the contract (including [[Octesian]]!)
- We find out where the market where the maids go to is.
