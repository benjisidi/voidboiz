# Description
This old, U-shaped white stone building sits overlooking the city of [[Lunavesca]]. A grand, 15ft tall statue of Selune dominates the main courtyard, looking down upon the flagstoned square from a plinth. The three sides of the Archives border the square, bounded by a small, shaded colonnade and large, arched windows.

Followers of [[Selune]] set up this institution for two reasons:
- As a repository of the knowledge in the [[New Harvest]] region.
- As an organisation to control the spread of [[Lycanthropy]] throughout the region.
# Services
* The followers of Selune will silver your weapons for 5gp per weapon. This keeps them silvered for one minute of combat.
* There are maps of the surrounding region and the wider world, and many scrolls and tomes, available for inspection. Some may be borrowed for a small fee.
