# The Battle against the [[Hag]]
The group faces off against the demon-possessed boy, Mateo, who transforms before their eyes. His small form elongates into something twisted and monstrous, his limbs stretching unnaturally, his eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.

Without hesitation, [[Rue]] launches a guiding bolt, striking the creature in the chest. [[Grey]] follows up with his hammer, landing a solid blow, while [[Octesian]] moves to flank the creature, daggers flashing. [[Lug]], wielding the power of [[Sunlight Symphony]], channels Silvery Fire, burning through the demon’s flesh.

The creature screeches as it lashes out wildly, its claws raking against [[Rue]] and [[Grey]], but the team maintains their formation. After a brutal exchange of attacks, they finally land a devastating sequence of blows, forcing the demon back.

Just as [[Grey]] raises his hammer for a finishing strike, the demon vanishes in a burst of black smoke, leaving behind only the scent of burning sulfur.
# Tracking the [[Hag]]
With Mateo gone, the group regroups and searches the ruins for further clues. [[Rue]] spots a faint trail, leading deeper into the forest—signs that someone else has been here recently. Older footprints suggest that an adult has been visiting the ruins in the past few weeks.

[[Lug]] uncovers a trapdoor hidden beneath some rubble. Inside, they find a locked chest containing:
- A scroll covered in ancient script
- A few potions
- 60 gold pieces

As [[Octesian]] inspects the chest, he finds a bottle of port—only to realize, too late, that it was poisoned. He collapses to the ground, barely conscious. [[Grey]] quickly administers divine magic, purging the poison before it can do lasting damage.

While the others recover, [[Grey]] makes a chilling discovery—scraps of a dress belonging to [[Lucia]], torn and scattered near the trapdoor. He picks them up and sniffs them (a little too enthusiastically).

With these new findings, the group makes their way back to town to regroup.
# The Revelation at [[Geo’s Vineyard]]
The group returns to [[Geo’s Vineyard]], where [[Lana Skylark]] is reading by candlelight, waiting for their report.

They unfurl the scroll, revealing a folktale about a pirate named [[Cpt. Flynn]] and his disappearing islands. It also contains a star map with directions—a major discovery.

The group recounts everything—the hag, the demon, the ruins, and [[Lucia]]’s possible involvement. [[Lana Skylark]] listens intently but is deeply unsettled. She jokingly asks if any of them are actually the hag, but when they hesitate to answer, she pricks her own finger, showing that she bleeds red—proving she is not a hag, as hags bleed black.

She then insists that everyone in the group do the same. Some comply more willingly than others, but eventually, everyone proves they are human.
# [[Lucia]] Is Missing
With the situation growing more dire, the group rushes to Lucia’s room to reclaim her spellbook—but when they arrive, it’s gone. Someone has already been here and taken it.

The realization sets in—Lucia must have beaten them to it and has now run off into the night.
# Searching for [[Lucia]]
Desperate to find her, the group wakes [[Rowan]], who is shocked at the news. He tells them that, as a child, Lucia would hide in the vineyard’s wine cellar whenever she was scared.

Grabbing his cutlass, he joins them in the search.
# The Cellar Confrontation
Descending into the dark, musty cellar, the group’s footsteps echo ominously. They move cautiously, torches flickering against the damp stone walls.

Suddenly, they spot Lucia’s slumped form on the floor.

Walking around her, chanting, is a second Lucia.
The group freezes.
Two Lucias.
One is real. One is not.

[[Rue]] quickly summons a rat, commanding it to bite one of them to determine who bleeds red and who bleeds black. The rat sinks its teeth into the unconscious Lucia—and immediately dies.

The group has no idea what that means.

Taking a bolder approach, [[Rue]] misty steps forward and nicks the unconscious Lucia’s finger—she bleeds red.

With no more hesitation, the group attacks the standing Lucia—the Hag in disguise.
# Executive Summary
The group tracks the Hag to the ruins, where they fight a demon disguised as a child. After defeating it, they find evidence that [[Lucia]] had been at the ruins recently, along with a poisoned chest and a hidden scroll containing the legend of [[Cpt. Flynn]].

Returning to [[Geo’s Vineyard]], the group realizes Lucia has fled, taking her spellbook with her. They wake [[Rowan]], who suggests checking the wine cellar, where they find two Lucias—one unconscious, one chanting.

Determining which is the real one, the group immediately attacks the standing Lucia—the Hag.
