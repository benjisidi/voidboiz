# The Fight against the [[Hag]]
The battle continues in the cellar of [[Geo’s Vineyard]], with the [[Hag]] using illusions and enchantments to try and escape.

The [[Hag]]’s eyes glow blue, and the door locks itself behind the party. She tries to flee through the wall, vanishing into the stone like it was water.
- [[Rue]] inspects the wall, trying to follow her, but it is now completely solid. She attempts to kick open the door in frustration but only ends up hurting her foot.
- [[Octesian]] pulls out his thieves’ tools and easily unlocks the door, surprising himself. He steps out into the larger storage room.
- [[Rue]] rushes in, swinging her staff at the Hag but misses twice in a row.
- [[Lug]] charges in and throws Archibald the Pebble at her, but it goes wide.
- [[Grey]] follows, summoning a crackling bolt of lightning and hitting the [[Hag]] in the chest.

The [[Hag]] lets out a sharp screech, then tosses a bag of shimmering dust at [[Octesian]]. He inhales the glittering powder and immediately collapses to the floor, unconscious.

Things aren’t going well.

Suddenly, [[El]] begins to shimmer and fade, her form blinking out of existence. She finds herself suspended in a cage of swirling void energy, floating in complete darkness.

The rest of the group fights desperately.
- [[Rue]] hurls a bolt of energy at the [[Hag]], but it hits a wine barrel instead, causing it to explode. [[Lug]] yells, “That was a good year!”
- [[Lug]] rushes over to [[Octesian]] and slaps him across the face, jolting him awake.

The room fills with crackling static energy, and suddenly, [[Grey]]’s tattoos begin glowing bright blue.

With a deep breath, he channels the power of [[Talos]] and calls down a massive lightning bolt, striking the [[Hag]] directly.

She screams as her form twists and bursts apart, leaving behind nothing but a charred mark on the floor. The fight is over. [[El]] reappears, covered in soot.
# The Aftermath
With the [[Hag]] gone, the group rushes to check on [[Lucia]], who remains unconscious on the floor. [[Rue]] feeds her a goodberry, and she slowly wakes up, completely disoriented and terrified.

She doesn’t remember much but immediately starts crying when she realizes what she has done.
# Back at [[Geo’s Vineyard]]
The group returns to [[Geo’s Vineyard]], where [[Rowan]] puts [[Lucia]] to bed. [[Geo]] arrives shortly after, confused and demanding answers.

Over tea, they explain everything—the hag, the summoning spell, the disappearances.

[[Geo]] is horrified. He doesn’t want the town to know what [[Lucia]] did, fearing she’ll be forced to leave. The group convinces him to keep it quiet for now.

Before bed, [[Lug]] sneaks back to retrieve the [[Hag]]’s book. [[Octesian]] spits on the pentagram before leaving.
# The [[Hag]]’s Book
The book appears to be a diary, chronicling the [[Hag]]’s influence over Terra Nova. It reveals that she was able to attack people through its pages, targeting them remotely.

The group wakes up to the smell of breakfast downstairs. [[Grey]] takes two plates of food. [[Rue]] eats mostly vegetables, much to everyone’s disappointment. They demand warm pastries.

[[Lucia]] joins breakfast later, but is not allowed any pastries as punishment. She apologizes and finally tells them where she got the spell scroll that summoned the [[Hag]].
# The Traveller with the [[Chantry]] Mark
[[Lucia]] explains that she bought the corrupted spell scroll from a bald, middle-aged man who passed through Terra Nova a few weeks ago.
- He had a tattoo of a flaming crown on the back of his hand.
- The symbol felt familiar, and the group realizes it matches the mark of the [[Chantry]], the radical sect of [[Kossuth]].
- The traveller was heading to [[Lunavesca]], likely to the Storm Church of [[Talos]].

The group debates their next move. [[Grey]] immediately recognizes the symbol—he saw it on the shields of the Chantry forces that attacked Greypeak and destroyed his home.

After some heated discussion, they decide to follow the traveller to Lunavesca.
# Departure for [[Lunavesca]]
The group prepares to leave for Lunavesca by carriage.

As they load up their supplies, [[Lucia]] appears, dressed in travelling clothes. She insists on coming with them—she wants to learn magic properly and make up for her mistakes.

[[Rue]] gives her the address of a trusted contact who can teach her safely but warns her to go slowly. [[El]] gives her a small speech about the power of magic. [[Lana Skylark]] agrees to take [[Lucia]] to the Grand Celarium for training.

With that, the group sets off for Lunavesca.
# Arrival in [[Lunavesca]]
After two days of travel, they arrive in Lunavesca, a massive walled city built on a lake, with a fort on the hill and a towering cathedral at its center.

Upon arrival:
- They check into The Polished Tree, a lavish inn near the Storm Church.
- [[Rowan]] finds two possible places to stay, but the group chooses the Polished Tree because it is closer to the church.
- They try to get a discount by calling themselves the Heroes of Terra Nova—it does not work.
- They drop off their gear and head straight for the market district.
# Shopping in the [[Lunavesca]] Market
The market district is chaotic and sprawling, full of street vendors, rare wares, and exotic goods.
- [[El]] looks for a new staff, preferably magical.
- [[Lug]] sells jewelry and old maps for gold.
- [[Grey]] and [[Lug]] visit a high-end jeweler, who sells items made of Gleamstone, a glass-like material formed from Talos’ lightning storms.
- They learn that Lunavesca hosts a monthly storm rite, where the followers of [[Talos]] summon a storm over the city.
- [[Lug]] tries to sell a gold bird statue, but its goblin craftsmanship lowers its value.
- They hear whispers about a powerful pirate named [[Ilbor]], who is rumored to have ties to the Blacksail Consortium.

The session ends with the group scattering through the market, gathering supplies, and preparing for their next move.
# Executive Summary
The group defeats the [[Hag]], saving [[Lucia]] and learning that she summoned it using a corrupted spell scroll sold to her by a traveller with the mark of the [[Chantry]].

The group follows the trail to Lunavesca, believing the traveller to be at the Storm Church of [[Talos]].

Upon arrival, they check into The Polished Tree and explore the market district, where they learn about the monthly storm ritual, the city’s history with [[Talos]], and rumors of the Blacksail pirates.
