# Escape from [[Mystras Temple]]
The group flees the collapsing temple as the binary star system destabilizes, its gravitational forces pulling everything toward destruction. The ground trembles beneath them as they sprint for the ship.

Outside, [[Lana Skylark]] and the crew of [[The Panther]] are waiting. The temple’s ancient stone walls crack as debris begins falling around them. The team boards the ship, and [[Lana Skylark]] gives the order to launch immediately.

As they pull away from the temple, a massive arcane golem emerges from the ruins, its crystalline body shimmering with residual temple magic. Before the group can process what they’re seeing, the golem raises its hands toward the ship and fires three beams of energy.

Two beams strike the ship, causing immediate damage. The sails catch fire from the magical energy, sending flames spreading across the deck.
# Fighting to Survive the Supernova
[[Grey]], [[Octesian]], and [[El]] rush to get the burning sails down while the crew stomps out the flames. Meanwhile, the star system’s collapse begins affecting the surrounding space, sending high-energy waves rippling outward.

The crew fights against chaotic weather as the waves grow higher, crashing against the ship. Everyone except [[Grey]] ties themselves to the ship. [[Grey]], confident in his balance, jumps into a barrel for protection. The first wave hits, sending him flying into the ship’s interior, slamming against the walls.

[[Rue]] loses her grip and slams into the ship’s railing, barely managing to hold on. [[Lug]] rushes to secure the cannons, but one breaks loose, slamming into [[Grey]] and pinning him against the wall. [[Octesian]] barely manages to pull him free before another wave crashes down.

The ship starts taking on water—the gunwales were left open in the chaos. [[Grey]] and [[El]] scramble to seal them shut as acidic rain begins falling from the sky, burning into their skin.
# A Desperate Plan
With the situation worsening, [[Arianwyn]] suggests a radical maneuver—using the supernova’s energy to escape the gravitational collapse.

The group agrees, knowing it’s their best chance to survive.

[[Lug]] and [[Arianwyn]] lower the remaining undamaged sails, using the sudden acceleration to push the ship toward the edges of the collapsing system. [[Octesian]] secures [[Rowan]] to the wheel, keeping him steady despite the turbulence. [[El]] and [[Grey]] double down on securing the cannons, making sure nothing else comes loose.

[[Rue]], still recovering from her earlier injury, focuses on healing herself.
# The Supernova Erupts
The stars collapse. The entire system explodes in a blinding white light.

The ship is thrown upward as the shockwave from the explosion sends it into the void. [[Grey]] is knocked unconscious from the force of impact. [[Octesian]] is nearly thrown overboard but barely manages to cling to the rigging. [[Lug]], in his panic, starts punching holes into the ship.

[[El]] reacts fast, seeing debris flying toward her and [[Grey]]. She catches a cannonball midair with her monk reflexes, preventing another critical impact. [[Rue]] moves quickly, casting a healing spell on [[Grey]], bringing him back to consciousness.
# Breaking Through the Maelstrom
As the ship is flung through the chaos, a massive maelstrom of energy forms in the wake of the explosion. They have only seconds to turn the ship or risk being caught in the turbulence.

[[Arianwyn]] falls from the crow’s nest as the ship lurches violently. As she plummets, she sprouts golden wings, flying back onto the ship just before hitting the deck.

[[Lug]] and [[El]] work together to turn the ship hard to port, narrowly dodging the incoming vortex. [[Rue]] transforms into a lizard, but it serves no real purpose beyond the chaos of the moment.

The ship finally breaks free from the gravitational pull of the supernova, emerging into the calm of the void. The group, exhausted and battered, takes a moment to breathe.
# Executive Summary
The party escapes the collapse of [[Mystras Temple]] as the binary star system begins to collapse into a supernova.

As they flee, a crystalline golem fires three energy beams at [[The Panther]], setting the sails on fire. While trying to escape, the crew faces multiple disasters—rogue waves, an acid storm, loose cannons, and structural damage to the ship.

[[Arianwyn]] suggests riding the supernova’s energy to break free from the collapsing system. The crew pulls off a daring manoeuvre, just barely escaping as the stars explode.

In the final moments, a massive energy vortex threatens to pull them back in. [[Arianwyn]] falls but reveals her celestial wings, saving herself. [[Lug]] and [[El]] manage to turn the ship at the last second, avoiding destruction.

[[The Panther]] emerges into open space, barely intact, but the crew survives.
