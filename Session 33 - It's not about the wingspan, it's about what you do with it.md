#a-quest-most-fowl
# The First Entry
The void boiz are invited into the home by a green warforged man ([[Baxter]]). They are led into the foyer where they wait a bit, and then get led into a room with a big split stairwell and then a side room.
We meet a human man ([[Lord Erebus]]), in his 40s, drinking out of a porcelain cup and he explains the quest
## A Quest Most Fowl
A couple of people have been murdered:
- Lady Blackmarch - while she was at a function at a ballroom (Barrington's Ball) (body mysteriously found) (stabbed) - Lord Erebus was at the same function
	- Both Blackmarch and [[Lord Erebus]] are both collectors (of rare artifacts)
- The lady's maid (Sabine) was found dead in her kitchen (house on the cliffside) - Found the maid a day or so later
- Well known tramp (Monty) was found dead in Leviathan's Shadow (underground market) - Found a day or so later
- Other suspect is Bower (tiefling) - but suspicions are racist
### Rewards
- **300 GP** each + expenses + lodging + cash from Baxter - for investigating at all
- **200 GP** each - for finding out who did it
- **everything in the vault** - if we can prove the lord did it (we don't think he did it)
# Investigation Continues
- Lug is really curious as to how you become a collector
- The void boiz accept and get a silver scroll that details the employment - the contract
- Everyone signs the contract (including [[Octesian]]!)
- We find out where the market where the maids go to is.
- Looks like [[Lord Erebus]] has an injury on his leg from a duel a long time ago
- As the void boiz leave they see a massive manticore flying around the manor (it belongs to [[Lord Erebus]], there was a painting of the two of them ❤️)
# The Blackmarch manor
- The void boiz head to Lady Blackmarch's manor, it's in the carved cliff. The house is empty apart from city guards (Twilight guards).
- They say they are independent investigators and ask to come in. It works!
- The guard shows them around - turns out this is the guard that found Sabine's
## Investigating Sabine's death
- The day after Lady Blackmarch was murdered the Twilight guards came to investigate if anyone knew anything in the manor
- Sabine was found in the pantry - very disturbing
- The guard leads us to the pantry. There is a pool of blood on the ground and around the pool of blood there are blood written runes (blood blood blood blood blood). It's written in Infernal (tieflings speak infernal oh no)
- The runes look like some necromantic ritual - a binding spell
	- But it looks like it was never finished
- All of the three bodies are at the fort
- Mages have seen the body but this is outside of their expertise
- The bodies are all being prevented from raising as undead (they cast a spell on the bodies)
	- Yay!
- No weapon found but stab wounds on Sabine's body
- There was only one other servant (the cook)
- The Lady's collection was never found, so the void boiz go and try to find it.
## Investigation montage
- Lug gets help from everyone and investigates the house
- In the pantry, under one of the legs of a shelf, he finds a small black feather - **a raven's feather**
- In the Lady's room we find a hidden safe in the wall.
	- Octesian sprays one of the lady's perfumes and sprays it in the air
	- Sees that droplets get sucked by the air in the safe into it
- Octesian sees that the safe is trapped and manages to disarm it. Gets a small vial of sprayable poison
- Octesian expertly opens the safe - cracking the code 46-32-12-87
	- Octesian canonically is a Math savant
- Inside the safe there is a marbley red stone, six pointed star. Looks like a key to something
